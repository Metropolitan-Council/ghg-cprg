<p>In 2022, the Twin-Cities MSA generated 52.01 million metric tons CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (MMtCO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions from the energy, transportation, industrial, waste, and agricultural sectors. Transportation was the largest contributor to GHG emissions (31.9%), followed by Industrial (23.6%), and Commercial (22.0%). Carbon sequestration from natural systems offset 3.3% of total emissions. In the methodology sector breakdown, we explain how electricity and natural gas emissions are calculated and apportioned to the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.</p>

<p>Emissions in the region fell by 21.3% from 2005 to 2022. This is principally attributed to decarbonization of the electric grid, which fell NA from 2005 to 2022. Other sectors showed small increases or decreases.</p>
