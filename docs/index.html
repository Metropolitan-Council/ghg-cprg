<p>In 2021, the Twin-Cities MSA generated 54.03 million metric tons CO<sub>2</sub> equivalent (MMtCO<sub>2</sub>e) emissions from the energy, transportation, industrial, waste, and agricultural sectors. Transportation was the largest contributor to GHG emissions (33.4%), followed by Industrial (22.9%), and Commercial (21.6%). Carbon sequestration from natural systems offset 4.7% of total emissions. In the methodology sector breakdown, we explain how electricity and natural gas emissions are calculated and apportioned to the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.</p>

<p>Emissions in the region fell by 18.0% from 2005 to 2021. This is principally attributed to decarbonization of the electric grid, which fell 46.9% from 2005 to 2021. Other sectors showed small increases or decreases.</p>
