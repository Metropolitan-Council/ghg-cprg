    "text": "Emissions by sector\nThe energy sector generated 28.49 MMtCO2e of emissions in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021. Most of the energy emissions are from electricity followed by natural gas. Other fuels (propane and kerosene) make up a small proportion of energy emissions in the metro.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Energy county level emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe transportation sector generated 8.76 MMtCO2e of emissions in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021. This is a county-level, activity-based estimate that accounts for the total number of vehicle trips that originate in the county, terminate in the county, or both originate and terminate within the county for passenger and medium-duty commercial vehicles. Heavy-duty commercial vehicles are only accounted for trips that both originate and terminate within the county.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Transportation county level emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEmissions from waste is the smallest of the three sectors in the Twin Cities MSA. Waste generated 1.49 MMtCO2e of emissions in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021. Solid waste, including landfills, recycling, and organics, generates the largest share of emissions in the waste sector, with wastewater treatment comprising a smaller share of waste emissions.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Waste and wastewater county level emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPotential sequestration from natural systems totaled 2.39 MMtCO2e in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021.

    "text": "1.2 Electricity\n\n1.2.1 Introduction\nEmissions from the electricity generation sector have declined by 54% in Minnesota since 2005, largely as a result of transitions in the grid towards energy sources such as wind and solar (MPCA 2023). In 2023, Minnesota Governor Walz signed a bill mandating a statewide carbon-free electricity standard by 2040. The law “establishes a standard for utilities to supply Minnesota customers with electricity generated or procured from carbon-free resources, beginning at an amount equal to 80% of retail sales for public utility customers in Minnesota in 2030 and increasing every 5 years to reach 100% for all electric utilities by 2040. The bill also requires that, by 2035, an amount equal to at least 55% of an electric utility’s total retail electric sales to customers in Minnesota must be generated or procured from eligible energy technologies.” Wisconsin has not adopted a similar carbon-free electricity standard, but a Wisconsin DNR report noted both the economic gains from such to the renewable energy economy in the state, as well as the opportunities for decarbonization (Holt 2019).\n\n\n1.2.2 Methods\nThe general workflow for quantifying electricity emissions is to identify all of the electric utilities that operate within our study area, collect any reporting they provide to the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin about the amount of energy delivered to all their customers (with reference to federal reporting sources where state-level reporting gaps exist), and apply EPA-provided emissions factors to the reported activity/energy deliveries to calculate estimated emissions. Methodologies for allocating utility activity reports to counties varies across MN and WI and are further described in the following section. Most inputs we use in the construction of our electricity emissions data set are of the highest quality rank (Table B.2), as they are either direct government-created data (e.g., emissions factors) or data reported to state/federal authorities (e.g., regulatory filings). However, for two Minnesota electric utilities – Elk River Municipal Utilities (Elk River Municipal Utilities 2022) and New Prague Utilities Commission (New Prague Utilities Commission 2022) – where regulatory filing data could not be sourced to quantify electricity deliveries, we referred to financial reporting documents published by the utilities.\nTotal regional emissions (Emissionsr) represents the sum of all recorded energy deliveries by utility i within county j, where i refers to each of the electric utilities operating across our region, and j refers to the eleven counties included in this inventory. Our regional total therefore represents an aggregation of electricity deliveries for all distinct utility-county records.\n\\[Emissions_r = \\Sigma (mWhDelivered_iCounty_j \\times {Emissions Factor}) \\]\nOur inventory takes a “demand-side” approach to emissions quantification and seeks to aggregate all reported delivery of energy to ALL customers served by utilities (meaning all customer types, inclusive of residential, commercial, industrial, and government accounts). This means that energy loss and use experienced by utilities in the process of energy generation and transmission, and delivery and resale to utilities operating outside of our study area, are not directly reflected in the numbers attributed to counties. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that annual electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) losses averaged about 5% of the electricity transmitted and distributed in the United States in 2018 through 2022. (Administration 2023)\nWhile our primary data collection does not include a breakout of electricity deliveries by sector, we do leverage year 2021 NREL SLOPE forecasts of electricity consumption (built from a base year of 2016 observed data) by sector (residential, commercial, industrial) at the county level to calculate modeled proportions of consumption by sector, which we then apply to our aggregate numbers to calculate estimated emissions by sector NREL (2017).\n\n1.2.2.1 Identifying utilities in scope\nTo identify the electric utilities that operate within our 11-county study area, we referred to maps and geospatial datasets capturing utility service areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin. To identify Wisconsin electric utilities, we downloaded the Electric Service Territory map maintained by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (Wisconsin Public Service Commission and Tomaszewski 2024). To identify Minnesota electric utilities, we downloaded the Electric Service Territory map maintained by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and the Minnesota IT Geospatial Information Office(Office 2023).\n\n\n1.2.2.2 Collecting and aggregating activity data from utilities\nAfter identifying which utilities operate within our study area within each state, we collect reporting submitted by these utilities to the relevant state and federal authorities and use a variety of approaches, depending on data availability, to allocate utility activity/energy deliveries to specific counties.\n\n1.2.2.2.1 Minnesota\nAll electric utilities authorized to do business in Minnesota are required to file an annual data report pursuant to MN Rules Chapter 7610. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission makes these reports searchable through an eFiling Site, and downloadable as Excel workbooks (Commerce 2005). For each utility identified in distinct_electricity_util_type_MN.RDS (a data product of minnesota_electricUtilities.R, a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Minnesota counties), we downloaded the relevant 2021 annual reports from this site (see note about Great River Energy in the previous section for caveats), except for North Branch Municipal Water and Light, which did not submit a 2021 report (we used their 2022 report as a substitution). Elk River Municipal Utilities and New Prague Utilities Commission did not file reports for 2021 or 2022, and so we used financial reports to identify their total electricity delivered; both utilities operated within only one county in our study area, which meant no estimation/allocation was necessary.\nWe wrote code to extract the county-level data reported in the report section titled “ITS DELIVERIES TO ULTIMATE CONSUMERS BY COUNTY FOR THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR” on the relevant annual data report Excel workbooks compiled into a folder directory, and created a table with three columns: county, utility, and mWh_delivered (megawatt-hours). By compiling this data for all utilities found to operate within our study area, aggregating all electricity deliveries at the county level becomes possible.\n\n\n1.2.2.2.2 Wisconsin\nAll municipal and investor-owned utilities authorized to do business in Wisconsin are required to file an annual report with financial and operational information pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 196.07. The Public Services Commission of Wisconsin makes these reports searchable through an E-Services Portal, and downloadable as either PDFs or Excel workbooks, with options to export only specific portions of the reports as spreadsheets (Public Service Commission of Wisconsin 2022). For each utility identified in distinct_electricity_util_type_WI.RDS (a data product of wisconsin_electricUtilities.R, a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Wisconsin counties), we downloaded the relevant 2021 annual reports from this site.\nA similar process was followed for the four Wisconsin cooperative utilities for which we referenced federal regulatory filings data to populate our dataset of electricity deliveries.\nBecause of the small amount of data, and the different data structures of the reports for municipally-, cooperatively-, and investor-owned utilities in Wisconsin, we hard-coded observed information into data frames rather than extracting data through a web scraper or document analyzer (see processed_wi_electricUtil_activityData.R).\n\n\n\n1.2.2.3 Emissions factors\nTo transform electricity deliveries (recorded in mWh) into emissions in metric tons CO2e, we referenced 2021 Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) summary data for the MROW subregion (Midwest Reliability Organization - West) (USEPA 2021a).\nThis dataset provides estimates in lbs/mWh for CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO2e emissions based on MROW’s sub-regional electricity generation grid mix; converting this factor to metric tons per mWh and multiplying the county-level mWh estimates yields an estimate for CO2e. To generate this sub-regional estimate, eGRID first calculates estimated emissions at the plant level, and assigns plants to regions. By using an emissions factor that is localized, our inventory accounts for the specific grid mix in our study area (see the grid mix linked to the eGRID MROW emissions factor used in this inventory below). Per the eGRID technical guide, “the subregions were defined to limit the import and export of electricity in order to establish an aggregated area where the determined emission rates most accurately matched the generation and emissions from the plants within that subregion.”\n\n\n\n\nTable 1.1: Grid Mix for MROW subregion of 2021 eGRID\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nEnergy.Source\nPercentage\n\n\n\n\nCoal\n39.6%\n\n\nOil\n0.2%\n\n\nGas\n10.6%\n\n\nOther Fossil\n0.10%\n\n\nNuclear\n8.6%\n\n\nHydro\n4.4%\n\n\nBiomass\n0.8%\n\n\nWind\n34.6%\n\n\nSolar\n0.9%\n\n\nGeothermal\n0.0%\n\n\nOther\n0.2%\n\n\nUnknown/Purchased Fuel\nN/A\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3 Results\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.3: 2021 county electricity emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.4: 2021 electricity emissions by sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3.1 Correlation with related data\nWe would expect counties with higher population to have higher emissions.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.5: County population and electricity emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3.2 Comparison with federal inventories\n\n1.2.3.2.1 Energy Information Administration (EIA)\nWe compared our county-level emissions figures to emissions estimates derived from the EIA’s State Electricity Profiles, which were generated by down-scaling EIA’s Minnesota and Wisconsin state-level numbers for total electricity retail sales. We achieved this by applying the proportions of each state’s population residing in each of our study area counties to generate county-level emissions estimates. Our inventory quantified 15,937,600 metric tons of electricity in our study area relative to 20,214,537 metric tons based on the aforementioned downscaled statewide retail numbers.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.6: Metropolitan Council emissions inventory vs. downscaled EIA State Electricity Profiles\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1.2.3.2.2 NREL SLOPE\nThe NREL SLOPE (State and Local Planning for Energy) Platform provides yearly forecasted emissions tied to the user of electricity up to 2050 based on 2016 reported data at the county level. In comparing these figures to our own inventory, we observed that, where we estimated 15,937,600 metric tons of emissions linked to electricity deliveries in our study area in the year 2021, NREL SLOPE forecasted 19,284,150metrics tons in our study area.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1.7: Metropolitan Council emissions inventory v.

Many local and state governments are evaluating policies to reduce natural gas usage, such as building electrification (when paired with decarbonization of the electric grid) and banning natural gas hookups in new construction.\n\n\n1.3.2 Methods\nThe general workflow for quantifying natural gas emissions is to identify all of the natural gas utilities that operate within our study area, collect any reporting they provide to the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin about the amount of energy delivered to all their customers, reference federal reporting sources where state-level reporting gaps exist, and apply EPA-provided emissions factors to the reported energy deliveries to calculate emissions.

To identify Wisconsin gas utilities, we downloaded the Natural Gas Service Territory map maintained by the Wisconsin Public Utilities Commission (Public Service Commission of Wisconsin 2021). Since Minnesota does not publish a state-maintained data set of natural gas service areas (Minnesota IT Services 2021), we used the Department of Homeland Security’s Natural Gas Service Territories map from its Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) portal to identify in-scope Minnesota gas utilities (Homeland Security 2017).\n\n\n1.3.2.2 Collecting and aggregating activity data from utilities\nAfter identifying which utilities operate within our study area within each state, we collected the reporting submitted by these utilities to the relevant state and federal authorities, and followed a distinct process for each state to accumulate data and then allocate energy deliveries to specific counties therein.\n\n1.3.2.2.1 Minnesota\nAll natural gas utilities authorized to do business in Minnesota are required to file an annual data report pursuant to MN Rules Chapter 7610 (Commerce 2005).

    "text": "2.1.1 Minnesota\nUnder Minnesota Administrative Rules Chapter 7610 (Commerce 2005), utilities are required to file an annual data report that supports the identification of “emerging energy trends based on supply and demand, conservation and public health and safety factors, and to determine the level of statewide and service area needs” (Minnesota Department of Commerce 2022). This includes a report of county-level energy deliveries (reported in megawatt-hours, commonly written as mWh). Because the information is structured in this manner, electricity emissions at the county-level can be estimated as a direct function of energy deliveries to counties reported by utilities.\nOne utility operating within our study area, Great River Energy (GRE), is a non-profit wholesale electric power cooperative which provides wholesale power and delivery services to 28 Minnesota-based electric cooperatives, which collectively own GRE and provide retail electric service. They are the primary supplier of energy (&gt;99%) to the cooperative utilities operating in our study area. Though most electricity suppliers having relationships with Minnesota electric utilities do not file these annual data reports, GRE does, given their unique hybrid wholesale/transmission structure and cooperative ownership model. As a result, while we keep only GRE’s reporting in our data collection for county-level electricity deliveries, we exclude reporting from these subsidiary retail electric cooperatives, in order to avoid double counting electric deliveries. We use GRE’s reported deliveries to our 9 Minnesota study area counties as a full substitution for the deliveries of these utilities, which may represent a marginal undercount given that marginal-to-negligible amounts of energy delivered by these retail cooperatives came from other other sources, per their annual reports.\n\n\n2.1.2 Wisconsin\nUnder Wis. Stat. § 196.07, investor- and municipally-owned electric utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of kWh) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Wisconsin State Legislature 2024).\nOf the seven in-scope electric utilities, only three (the investor- and municipally-owned utilities) were required to make these reports to the State in 2021 (four of the in-scope electric utilities are cooperative utilities); state data was leveraged in this case. For the four utilities (all cooperative utilities) not making these reports, we relied upon the detailed data files provided by the EIA, recording the responses of utilities to the Annual Electric Power Energy Report (Form EIA-861), which records retail sales by utilities and power marketers (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2023). Two utilities (Dunn Energy Cooperative and Polk-Burnett Electric Cooperative) filled the long version of the form (filled by larger entities), and two (St. Croix Electric Cooperative and Pierce-Pepin Electric Cooperative Services) filled the short form (filled by smaller entities). For our purposes, both the long and short form provided suitable activity information (total energy delivered, total customers) to allocate energy deliveries to counties in concert with Census population data, in the process outlined below.\nBecause Wisconsin utilities do not report energy deliveries at the county level, it was necessary to estimate energy deliveries by a given utility i within a particular county j. For those three utilities who reported county-level customer counts and total customer counts to the state, we estimated mWh delivered by utility i in county j by multiplying their total statewide energy deliveries (as reported to the relevant state authorities) by the proportion of their customers residing in each of our two study area counties.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\nNote: This approach implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when this is influenced by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county.\nTo calculate the estimated energy delivered by utility i in county j for the four cooperatively-owned utilities that did not report county-level customer counts (i.e., did not report to the State), we used population figures to estimate/allocate reported electricity deliveries to counties. We took the actual total energy delivered by utility i across Wisconsin (as reported to the relevant federal authorities) and multiplied this by the proportion of total population within each utility’s entire service area residing within county j at the 2020 decennial Census.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhDelivered_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulation_j}) \\]\nThe factor ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulationj was calculated by spatially joining Census block centroids containing population data to 1) polygons representing the entirety of our in-scope utilities’ service areas (including areas outside of St. Croix and Pierce counties) and 2) polygons representing only the portions of these utilities’ service areas within a) St. Croix county and b) Pierce County. These utility-county service areas are calculated separately, to facilitate an informed allocation of statewide energy use to each county in turn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommerce, Minnesota Department of. 2005.

    "text": "3.1.1 Minnesota\nUnder Minnesota Administrative Rules Chapter 7610 (Commerce 2005), utilities are required to file an annual data report that supports the identification of “emerging energy trends based on supply and demand, conservation and public health and safety factors, and to determine the level of statewide and service area needs.” (Minnesota Department of Commerce 2022) This includes a report of county-level energy deliveries (reported in thousand cubic feet, commonly written as mcf). Because the information is structured in this manner, natural gas emissions at the county-level can be estimated as a direct function of energy deliveries to counties reported by utilities, which is not the case in Wisconsin (some modeling and estimation is required in WI).\n\n\n3.1.2 Wisconsin\nUnder Wis. Stat. § 196.07, investor-owned natural gas utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of therms) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Wisconsin State Legislature 2024). Because all four “in-scope” natural gas utilities in Wisconsin are investor-owned, we did not have to refer to federal sources or use population figures to estimate energy deliveries. We estimated county-wide emissions from natural gas in 2021 by first calculating the proportion of each utility customer accounts that were linked to either Pierce or St. Croix counties, and allocating that proportion of the utility’s total reported energy delivery to each county. This approach represents a divergence from our Minnesota process, which involves aggregating county-level numbers directly reported by utilities, and implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when in actuality this is likely impacted by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county.\n\\[mcfDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mcfEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCommerce, Minnesota Department of. 2005.

These estimates are provided every 5 years, most recently in 2020 (US EIA 2023). The American Community Survey, curated by the US Census Bureau, provides the estimated number of households using each fuel type at more granular spatial and temporal scales, including county level estimates in 2021. Energy generation and GHG emissions from these fuels was estimated for each of the 11 counties in our 2021 inventory using these two data sources in combination. Both data sources are from federal governmental agencies, categorized as the highest rank of data quality (Table B.2).\nEIA RECS data was downloaded from their data portal. EIA surveyed 32,882 households nationally for 2020 data and provides estimated mmBtu (millions of British thermal units) generation from propane per household using that fuel at the state level and at the Midwest regional level for kerosene. ACS data was accessed using the tidycensus package in R. ACS conducted 62,778 household interviews in Minnesota in 2021 and provides county estimates of the number of households using a given fuel. Multiplying the estimated mmBtu generated per household in a given region by the county-level estimate of households using the fuel provides a county-level estimate of mmBtu generation from each of propane and kerosene and is then converting to CO2 equivalency using the EPA’s emission factors. This approach assumes energy generation per household per fuel is equal across each state (for propane) and the Midwest region (for kerosene).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: 2021 annual liquid stationary fuel emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS EIA. 2023. “2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey: Consumption and Expenditures Technical Documentation Summary.” Government.

The county-level GHG emissions included in the NEI for this category are calculated by running the MOVES model with State-, Local-, and Tribal-submitted activity data and EPA-developed activity inputs based on data from FHWA and other sources (USEPA 2023).\nNEI data were pulled using the EnviroFacts API and processed in R scripts: epa_nei.R and epa_nei_transportation.R\nWe expect that the NEI data will show higher emissions, because it is based on overall activity, not explicit origin-destination travel.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: County estimated emissions, NEI and calculated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.3.2.2 Local Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (LGGIT)\nEPA’s Local Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (LGGIT) was developed to help communities across the United States to evaluate their greenhouse gas emissions. We used the LGGIT to validate our calculations and datasets (US EPA 2017).\nWe used the LGGIT Excel workbook tool with the following inputs in the “Mobile-Data” sheet. Several calculations and assumptions were made\n\nPassenger VMT was split between gasoline and diesel powered vehicles based on regional fleet composition in the Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI).\nPassenger vehicle age was determined from the median vehicle model year in the TBI. See Section 7.4.1 for more detail.\nFuel consumption was calculated by dividing VMT by average vehicle miles per gallon (MPG), specific to vehicle type and fuel type.\nFuel efficiency data were taken from the LGGIT tool and verified with the EPA Emission Factors Hub (2021 edition) (USEPA 2021).\n\nAll medium-duty VMT were classified as “Light Truck”, while all heavy-duty VMT were classified as “Heavy-Duty Vehicle”.\n\nCommercial trucks were assumed to be year 2007, based on a 2018 report that found the average age of trucks in the US to be 14.2 years (Brusseau 2019) (2021 - 14 = 2007).\n\nLGGIT entries and resulting output tables were generated and processed in epa_lggit.R.\n\n\n\n\nTable 6.1: Mobile data entered into LGGIT\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nID\nUnit Description\nSector\nVehicle Year\nVehicle Type\nVehicle Model (optional)\nFuel Type\nFuel Consumption\nVMT\n\n\n\n\n1\nPassenger Car Gasoline\nResidential\n2013\nPassenger Car\n\nGasoline\n943,537,473\n22,739,253,097\n\n\n2\nPassenger Car Diesel\nResidential\n2014\nPassenger Car\n\nDiesel\n8,524,236\n276,185,260\n\n\n3\nMedium-duty\nCommercial/Institutional\n2007\nLight Truck\n\nDiesel\n37,318,257\n824,733,487\n\n\n4\nHeavy-duty\nCommercial/Institutional\n2007\nHeavy-Duty Vehicle\n\nDiesel\n10,186,928\n132,022,580\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the LGGIT tool estimate a regional emissions total of 8,891,741 metric tons CO2e, while our calculations estimate 8,757,962 metric tons CO2e.

Additionally, LGGIT uses global warming potential (GWP) values from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5) (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014), while our calculations use slightly higher values from the 6th Assessment Report (AR6) (IPCC 2023).

For this project, we used StreetLight to find the volume of traffic (number of vehicles) and average trip length for passenger and commercial vehicles.\nThe Metropolitan Council used StreetLight for our 2018 inventory.\nFor ease of access, we used {streetlightR} to interact directly with the StreetLight API. {streetlightR} is an open-source R package maintained by Council staff. We also used StreetLight InSight®, an online interface for running StreetLight analyses. Our subscription to StreetLight is part of MnDOT’s transportation analysis with regional data for informed strategies program. StreetLight falls second, only behind government data sources, in the data quality table (Table B.2).\nUsing the API, we uploaded the CPRG county geography and then performed an origin-destination analysis, in which all counties were both an origin and destination. This resulted in detailed vehicle counts for traffic between and within each of the counties. The data were then pulled and cleaned for estimating passenger and commercial VMT. The data were filtered to ensure all day types and day parts were included in the VMT calculations. Analyses were configured to include all months in 2021 and the most recent metric version (R131-M129) available was used.\nAll StreetLight API operations are recorded in R scripts: stl_upload_zone_sets.R, stl_run_analyses.R, and stl_fetch_analyses.R.",

StreetLight uses a sample of devices with location-based services (LBS) and vehicles with location technology (connected vehicle data) to model number of vehicles (StreetLight Data 2024).\nThe models that make up StreetLight Volume predict vehicle volumes by combining location-based services (LBS) and connected vehicle trips with contextual features that represent the street network, demographics, climate, and other geographic characteristics (StreetLight Data 2023a). The models are validated against data permanent traffic counters across the country, including in the study area.\nStreetLight provides a rough sample size for the entire analysis, as shown in Table 7.1.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.1: StreetLight passenger travel analysis sample size\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData periods\nMode of travel\nApproximate device count\nApproximate trip count\n\n\n\n\nJan 01, 2021 - Dec 31, 2021\nAll Vehicles LBS Plus - StL All Vehicles Volume\n1,038,000\n125,411,000\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.1 Trip length validation\nStreetLight returns not only vehicle volume, but also trip attributes, like trip length.

Read more about the TBI in Section 7.4.\nFigure 7.4 shows a strong positive correlation when comparing origin-destination pairs. Note that TBI origin-destination pairs with fewer than 30 observed trips were removed due to low sample size.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.4: Avg. trip distance, Travel Behavior Inventory and StreetLight\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would also expect that large counties will have longer trip lengths and smaller counties will have shorter trip lengths.\nComparing trip distance and county area, we see a weakly positive correlation (the larger the county, the longer the average trip).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: Avg. distance for trips within county and county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.2 Commercial\nStreetLight does not provide StreetLight Volume for 2021 commercial vehicle analyses. To measure volume for commercial traffic, we used the StreetLight Index, a relative measure of traffic volume, calibrated using AADT values to result in traffic volume (StreetLight Data 2023b).\nStreetLight compares the AADT calibration values for a given zone with StreetLight’s sample size for the same zone, and creates a calibration factor to apply to the entire analysis (StreetLight Data 2023d). We generated a calibration zone set for commercial traffic by selecting road segments with both AADT and vehicle classification data in both MN and WI counties within the CPRG study area.

We believe this configuration aligns most closely with both StreetLight’s and MOVES’s vehicle classifications schemes.\nHowever, vehicles falling in FHWA class 7 (&gt; 26,000 lbs, &lt; 33,000 lbs) are classified as medium duty by state DOTs, and heavy duty by StreetLight. This discrepancy is relatively small, and is unlikely to heavily influence emissions reported.\n\n\n\n\nTable 7.3: Vehicle weight classifications by data source\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\nGross vehicle weight rating (lbs)\nFHWA\nDOT\nStreetLight\n\n\n\n\n&lt;6000\nClass 1: &lt;6,000 lbs\nLight-duty\nLight-duty\n\n\n10,000\nClass 2: 6,001-10,000lbs\nLight-duty\nLight-duty\n\n\n14,000\nClass 3: 10,001-14,000 lbs\nLight-duty\nLight-duty\n\n\n16,000\nClass 4: 14,001-16,000 lbs\nMedium-duty\nMedium-duty\n\n\n19,500\nClass 5: 16,001-19,500 lbs\nMedium-duty\nMedium-duty\n\n\n26,000\nClass 6: 19,501-26,000 lbs\nMedium-duty\nMedium-duty\n\n\n33,000\nClass 7: 26,001-33,000 lbs\nMedium-duty\nHeavy-duty\n\n\n&gt;33,000\nClass 8+: &gt;33,001 lbs\nHeavy-duty\nHeavy-duty\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo create the calibration dataset, we found the ratio of passenger/medium/heavy-duty vehicles at traffic count stations within our study area using state DOT data. You can read more about vehicle classification data in Section 7.2.2.\n\n\n\n7.1.3 Total vehicle volume validation\nTo validate our county origin-destination VMT data, we can compare the county totals to the DOT reported values from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021a) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2021). Note that these data include all vehicle types, both passenger and commercial.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.9: County vehicle miles traveled and StreetLight Volume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.4 Limitations\n\nThe data used for passenger traffic contains “all vehicles”, not just passenger vehicles, meaning that commercial vehicles may be double counted. As a default, StreetLight suggests that users use a ratio of 96/2/2 (96% passenger, 2% medium, 2% heavy). We could apply a scaling factor of 0.96 to the passenger data to account for this.\nCommercial vehicle classifications schemes differ across data sources, though the scale of this effect is unknown.",

    "text": "7.2 State DOT data\nAs required by federal law, Minnesota and Wisconsin state departments of transportation (MnDOT and WisDOT) report various traffic measures for planning, forecasting, and various analysis endeavors.\n\n7.2.1 Vehicle miles traveled\nVehicle miles traveled (VMT) is a standardized measure created by multiplying average annual daily traffic (AADT) by centerline miles. AADT is an estimate of the total vehicles on a road segment on any given day of the year in all directions of travel. VMT and AADT are common traffic measures and standardized across the United States.\nMnDOT and WisDOT derive VMT using traffic counts from continuous and short term traffic monitoring sites. These raw counts are adjusted by multiplying seasonal, day-of-week, and axle adjustment factors WisDOT (2023). Data is not collected for every site every year, but the data are sufficient for year-over-year comparisons.\nThese data were compiled from MnDOT and WisDOT county level reports. MnDOT provides Excel workbooks with VMT by county and route system on their website. These were downloaded, filtered to include the relevant counties, and aggregated to the county level by summing VMT by county/route system. Processing code can be found in mndot_vmt_county.R.\nWisDOT publishes PDF tables with county-level VMT. These were downloaded and data was extracted using {tabulizer}, an R package interfacing with the Tabula PDF extractor library. Processing code can be found in wisdot_vmt_county.R.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.10: County vehicle miles traveled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.2 Vehicle distribution by weight\nTo calibrate the generalized StreetLight Index to get commercial vehicle counts, we created a set of spatial lines (roads) to calibrate StreetLight’s metrics. For each calibration road, we found the proportion of passenger, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles in the most recently available year, up to 2021.\nState DOTs operate vehicle classification stations, which provide both the volume of traffic on a given road segment and, for some locations, the breakdown of volume by vehicle type. We obtained this breakdown using data from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021b) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2020) reporting websites.\nMnDOT provides AADT road segments, which align with station identification numbers. Wisconsin does not readily supply AADT road segment data, so as suggested by the Wisconsin cartographers office (State Cartographer’s Office 2021) we pulled OpenStreetMaps road data (OSM version 0.6).\nThen, we selected only the stations within the study area with observations in the last five years (2017-2021). Finally, we joined this data with AADT WisDOT (2021) road segments by station ID. The road segments sampled include multiple road functional classes and segments in all counties. All traffic sensor stations pulled were permanent, continuous monitoring sites. Data were cross-validated by verifying AADT and weight distribution fields on MnDOT and WisDOT traffic mapping applications.\nData were processed in R scripts: wisdot_stations.R, mndot_extract_yearly_volume_trends.R, mndot_stations.R, calibration_lines_points.R.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.11: StreetLight calibration locations and values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 27 calibration roads were used for this inventory due to data availability constraints.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.12: Vehicle weight distribution at calibration points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7.2.3 Limitations\n\nAADT/VMT data rely on modeling, and not every site will have new observed data every year.\nAADT/VMT are generally estimated for high-use arterial roads and highways, leaving local roads out.\nWe may want to consider using non-permanent counters and/or counters from just outside the study region to increase the total number of calibration roads.",

    "text": "7.3 EPA MOVES\nEmissions rates for our region were calculated using the EPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES) (USEPA 2016). MOVES calculates emissions factors using Council’s regional travel demand model, Minnesota Department of Vehicle Services’ county vehicle registration data, and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s vehicle age distribution. Each of these inputs helps the model estimate the characteristics of vehicles on the road in our region. The model takes into account differences in fuel economy (miles per gallon) depending on a vehicle’s age and size, as well as its fuel intake (diesel or gasoline). The results are specific to the conditions of our region, and so are more accurate than national averages.\nMOVES is a high-quality, government modeling system with strong data inputs and outputs. We requested this data from our MOVES coordinator who ran the model and shared the resulting table with us. The model run covers the entirety of the 7-county metro for years 2018 and 2019 1, using MOVES version 2014B.\nThe resulting table provides grams of CO2, CH4, and N2O per vehicle mile traveled. We imported, processed, and saved the data in an R script, epa_moves.R. CO2 equivalence (CO2e) values are derived using global warming potential (GWP) values.

However, the traffic generated from those vehicles is detected in the regional travel demand model.\nMOVES values were last updated in 2019.

Solid waste emissions primarily consist of CH4, emitted in large part by landfills and organics composting, but also include CO2 and N2O generation. In the metropolitan area, waste incineration accounts for a significant portion of solid waste management and therefore emissions. This inventory also includes emissions generated in the management of recyclables.\nWastewater emissions account for direct CH4 and N2O emissions from the treatment of municipal wastewater, and not additional indirect anthropogenic emissions such as the electricity needed to operate processing plants.",

Both state’s use state or federal data sources, the highest quality data rank (Table B.2).\nFor Minnesota counties, waste generation totals are allocated by sector from Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) SCORE data (MPCA 2022). Totals for each sector are multiplied by the appropriate EPA-provided emissions factor to provide an estimate of emissions from that source and county. Learn more about MPCA SCORE in Section 10.1.\nFor Wisconsin counties, state-level emissions data as calculated by the Wisconsin DNR is allocated to the relevant counties by population (Wisconsin DNR 2021).\nThe emissions for each county \\(c\\) are proportional to its fractional share of Wisconsin’s population.\n\\[Emissions_c = Emissions_{total} \\times \\frac{Pop_c}{Pop_{total}}\\]\n\n\n9.2.2 Wastewater\nWe used state level estimates of municipal wastewater emissions (metric tons CO2e) from the EPA state inventory and projection tool (USEPA 2024). Due to incomplete data, industrial wastewater emissions were not estimated.

    "text": "9.3 Results\nEmissions from waste is the smallest of the three sectors in the Twin Cities MSA. Waste generated 1.49 MMtCO2e of emissions in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021. Solid waste, including landfills, recycling, and organics, generates the largest share of emissions in the waste sector, with municipal wastewater treatment comprising a smaller share of waste emissions.\nWaste emissions in Minnesota have declined nearly 40% since 2005, due to a variety of factors including gas capture technologies and aging waste in open landfills (MPCA 2023). Waste emissions in Wisconsin show no significant change from 2005 to 2018, possibly due to increased waste generation offsetting reductions from gas capture (Wisconsin DNR 2021). The Metropolitan Council, which oversees wastewater services for the majority of the urbanized extent of the metropolitan region, continues to work to reduce wastewater emissions across its 9 wastewater treatment plants.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: Solid waste and wastewater county emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Solid waste and wastewater county emissions by category\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.1 Wastewater\nWastewater generated 0.33 MMtCO2e of emissions in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.3: 2021 wastewater emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.3.2 Solid waste\nSolid waste generated 1.15 MMtCO2e of emissions in the Twin Cities MSA in 2021.

In Hennepin, Ramsey, and Washington counties, municipal centers where a significant portion of waste is incinerated, waste-to-energy or incineration makes up a large fraction of emissions as well.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.5: 2021 solid waste emissions by category",

It also publishes statewide totals consistent with the national inventory. These emissions totals are consistent with international standards for greenhouse gas accounting, although they may differ from inventories completed at the state level for various reasons.\nUS Inventory data for the waste sector in both Minnesota and Wisconsin was downloaded from the Greenhouse Gas Inventory Data Explorer and processed in R script: epa_inventory_data.R, where it was apportioned from state to county level by population.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.7: Solid waste emissions comparison: Met Council and US GHG Inventory\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWastewater comparisons are very consistent, with the US GHG Inventory consistently estimating more emissions than the EPA derived Met Council estimate.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.8: Wastewater emissions comparison by county, EPA-derived Met Council and US GHG Inventory. US inventory consistently higher than Council.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSolid waste emissions differences vary by county; while Ramsey, Hennepin and Washington county estimates from the US GHG Inventory are higher than the Council estimates, the opposite is true for Dakota and Anoka counties. This is likely related to the fact that Ramsey, Hennepin and Washington counties process a significant portion of their waste in waste-to-energy facilities, reducing the amount of emissions accounted for under the landfill category.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9.9: Landfill emissions comparison by county, Met Council and US GHG Inventory.

For this project, we used MPCA data for the nine Minnesota counties for the year 2021. SCORE is named for the Governor’s Select Committee on Recycling and the Environment, which first proposed funding laws in 1989 (MPCA 2023a).\nThe SCORE data is a high-quality government dataset submitted annually by solid waste staff in each county of Minnesota, as a part of Minnesota’s SCORE laws to support waste reduction and calculate the cost of managing waste and recycling. The data provided includes the total short tons of waste generated in each county within each “Method” category, described below.\nThe data was accessed through the SCORE tool’s Tableau dashboard, then filtered to include only the 9-county Minnesota portion of the region studied in this report.",

    "text": "10.1.0.1 Data distribution\nTo check if the data is reasonable, we can start by visualizing the tons of waste generated for each county, broken into categories.\nWe would generally expect waste from landfills to be greater than recycling, and both landfill and recycling waste to be greater than compost (or “organics”). We can see that this expectation largely holds true, with the exception of Ramsey County, where compost outstrips both recycling and landfill. Part of the explanation for this may lie in the fact that, like Hennepin and Washington, a large portion of Ramsey County’s waste is managed in Waste-to-Energy facilities rather than landfills. This is consistent with waste management strategies of the metropolitan areas within Ramsey, Hennepin and Washington counties (Alexander 2020).\nWe also note that only two counties, Chisago and Sherburne, processed waste through onsite waste processors in 2021.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.1: Total waste generated by county\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect that the total amount of waste generated would be generally positively correlated with county area.\nWe see that this correlation holds loosely. The major outlier is Ramsey County, which includes the St. Paul metropolitan area.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.2: Total waste generated by county and county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect that counties with large populations would generate more waste, and we observe a strong positive correlation.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.3: Total waste generated by county and county population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.1 Data characteristics\nThis data includes MSW Compost as a category, but since all values for this category in the area and year needed were 0, we excluded it from our analysis.\nUncertainty was not included in the dataset given, nor does the EPA offer guidance for estimating uncertainty of solid waste emissions factors.\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.2 Waste management classification\nThe MPCA SCORE report classifies waste management by two management methods and, within those categories, five sub-methods (MPCA 2023b). Within the management methods, “MMSW”, or “Mixed Municipal Solid Waste”, refers to garbage, organic refuse, or other solid waste aggregated for collection, while “Combined Recycling and Organics” refers to separated recyclable and composted materials, including traditional recyclables, source-separated compostable materials, and yard trimmings.\nMMSW includes the subcategories of Landfill, Waste to Energy (WTE), Onsite, and MSW Compost. Landfill is all material disposed of in a landfill. WTE refers to waste combusted in an energy recovery facility or incinerator. Onsite refers to burning or burying MSW (MPCA 2023b). No metropolitan counties reported any MSW Compost in the year 2021. Only Sherburne and Chisago counties reported waste managed on-site.\nCombined Recycling and Organics includes the subcategories Recycling and Organics. Organics, as compared to MSW Compost, refers to source-separated and direct compost streams. All compost data in this report comes from this category.\nAfter comparing with federal tools like the EPA’s Waste and Recycling National Overview and the expectations of a greenhouse gas inventory, we chose to summarize SCORE’s data into three categories: Landfill, Recycling, and Organics. Landfill includes, in addition to MPCA-reported Landfill data, the categories of Onsite and WTE management.\n\n10.1.2.1 Alignment with EPA Emissions Factors\nWe used emissions factors from the EPA’s Emission Factors Hub to calculate emissions based on the totals reported by the MPCA. These emissions factors come from the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model.\nWe selected for each management subcategory the emissions factor most aligned with the waste type as reported in SCORE. These emissions factors do not take into account emissions savings associated with a particular management method, for example energy savings from waste to energy facilities.\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.1: Solid waste management classifications by data source, including emissions factors\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMPCA Management Method\nMPCA Method\nOur Category\nEmissions Factor Name\nEmissions Factor\n\n\n\n\nMMSW\nLandfill\nLandfill\nMixed MSW Landfilled\n0.52\n\n\nMMSW\nOnsite\nLandfill\nMixed MSW Landfilled\n0.52\n\n\nMMSW\nWTE\nWaste to Energy\nMixed MSW Combusted\n0.43\n\n\nMMSW\nMSW Compost\nOrganics\nN/A\nN/A\n\n\nCombined Recycling and Organics\nOrganics\nOrganics\nMixed Organics Composted\n0.17\n\n\nCombined Recycling and Organics\nRecycling\nRecycling\nMixed Recyclables Recycled\n0.09\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n10.1.3 Limitations\n\nAs mentioned above, EPA emissions factors do not account for emissions saved through Waste to Energy conversions, as contrasted with Wisconsin emissions, which do.\nThere is wide variation between emissions factors for waste of various kinds within the same category. Because we do not have a detailed breakdown of the makeup of every category, we have assumed each one is adequately represented by the “Mixed MSW”, “Mixed Organics”, and “Mixed Recyclables” factors respectively.\nThis estimation method generates emissions for all waste generated in 2021. However, waste in landfills and composting facilities does not release all emissions at once. This method tends to overestimate emissions for a given year (Fong et al. 2021).",

    "text": "10.2 Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory\nWaste emissions for Wisconsin counties were unavailable in the same detail as the MPCA data. Thus, we estimated total waste emissions based on statewide emissions estimates, allocated by population.\nThe most recent Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory was done in 2018 by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Included in the solid waste data for this source are emissions from landfills and waste combustion, taking into account the emissions reduced by landfill gas collection for gas-to-energy use or flaring. This inventory does not, however, include emissions generated from composting or recycling.\nThe emissions for solid waste in this report were calculated using the EPA’s State Inventory and Projection Tool, a tool designed to help states calculate greenhouse gas emissions (USEPA 2024a). Default values provided by the tool were used except in the case of default Mixed Solid Waste population tonnage values, which were replaced by data from the Wisconsin state DNR Annual Waste Tonnage Report (Wisconsin DNR 2021).\nFor 2018, the Wisconsin DNR reported 2.2 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) generated through landfilling and solid waste management.\nIn the process of analysis, this statewide estimate was apportioned to the county level based on county population data, as detailed in Section 9.2.\n\n10.2.1 Limitations\n\nSince data reported directly from the counties was unavailable for Wisconsin, the solid waste data used here reflects a disaggregation of state-level data and may not be reflective of the specific mix of waste generated by Pierce and St. Croix counties.\nData collected in Wisconsin’s emissions inventory only represents waste disposed of in landfills or waste combustion facilities, and does not include organics or recycling. Recycling and composting data is unavailable for Wisconsin counties.\n\n\n\n10.2.2 Comparison to similar datasets\nThe US EPA completes yearly state-level estimates of emissions for each state, which combined sum to the totals reported in the US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory. The data for these estimates and the US inventory can be explored at the GHG Inventory Data Explorer. The EPA’s total of landfill emissions for Wisconsin for 2018 was 2.450 MMTCO2e, not far off from the Wisconsin DNR’s 2.2 MMTCO2e. The EPA’s estimate for 2021 was 2.422 MMTCO2e. More details can be found in Section 9.5.\nSince the EPA completes an inventory for the entire US and its methods may not reflect the specific nuances of emissions in each state, we elected to use the data from the Wisconsin DNR for this inventory.",

    "text": "10.3 Wastewater\nWe explored three sources for wastewater emissions: the EPA state inventory and projection tool, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) emissions inventory, and Metropolitan Council Environmental Services emission estimates. Because only the EPA’s estimate extends to Wisconsin and Minnesota, we are reporting those data for consistency, but explore all three below where they have geographic overlap.\nThe EPA estimate is a high-quality government dataset that models emissions using state population, biochemical oxygen demand, fraction of wastewater anaerobically digested, fraction of population on septic, estimated protein content, and biosolids used as fertilizer to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions (USEPA 2024b). These inputs are modifiable and will be explored further in the CCAP. We apportioned the state level emission estimates to county levels by population percentage.\nThe EPA tool provides outputs in metric tons CO2e. We confirmed that the global warming potentials (GWP) used are from AR5 (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014). We used the most recent version of the tool released in January 2024, version 2024.1.\nWe are currently using default input values provided by the EPA, though will refine these based on our knowledge of local wastewater treatment in the future.\nYou can access the EPA tool on the EPA website and the MPCA data through their Tableau Dashboard. You can also read full methodologies for MPCA (Claflin et al. 2023) and EPA (USEPA 2024a) in their respective documents.\n\n10.3.1 Data characteristics\nThere are many sources of uncertainty in these estimates due to multiple activity data inputs required for CH4 and N2O emission estimates. The EPA wastewater module does not offer guidance on quantifying these sources of uncertainty, only describing the potential sources themselves. We have not included any uncertainty estimates in our final values.\n\n\n10.3.2 Limitations\n\nIn order to have homogeneous comparisons among counties, we are relying on default EPA state inventory and projection tool data which may miss particularities about how wastewater is processed in our narrower county scope.\nWe are assuming EPA default input values are appropriate representations of the 11 county MSA region and that we can scale to county levels by population given that we are estimating municipal wastewater treatment.\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Comparison with similar datasets\nThe Metropolitan Council, MPCA, and EPA source data leads to different estimates of emissions in the common seven county region. The Metropolitan Council does not process all wastewater in the seven county region. Additionally, they report CO2 emissions from combustion of stationary fuels for infrastructure used in directly processing wastewater, unlike EPA estimates which are CH4 and N2O emissions from municipal wastewater treatment of organic matter.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10.4: County aggregated wastewater emissions by scope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 10.2: Wastewater data sources and geographic scopes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData source\nGeographic scope\n\n\n\n\nEPA GHG Inventory and Projection Tool\nMinnesota and Wisconsin, scaled to county population\n\n\nMPCA GHG Inventory\nMinnesota, scaled to county population\n\n\nMetropolitan Council Wastewater Emissions Estimate\n7-county Minnesota metro area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Council area covers most of the 7-county Twin Cities area, but no areas in Wisconsin (Metropolitan Council 2020).

Photosynthesis is the central mechanism of this process and vegetation is therefore the focal land cover classification for quantifying the potential for regions to both sequester and store carbon. Different ecosystems have varying capacities for carbon capture and this work focuses on five broad classifications: urban trees, urban grasslands (i.e. turf grass), forests, natural grasslands, and wetlands. The distinction between tree and grassland cover in developed areas (i.e. urban) is important as despite having similar sequestration rates, urban natural systems are generally understood to have smaller storage capacities. The preservation and restoration of natural systems will be a key tool in limiting atmospheric greenhouse gases.",

These datasets complement each other as WorldCover provides finer spatial resolution and classifies green spaces within urban areas, whereas the NLCD products can split and downscale green space area in developed lands from those in non-developed lands, offering an important distinction between carbon sequestration and stock capacities. Specifically the NLCD ‘Developed’ land classification was used to assign the ‘urban’ label to WorldCover tree and grassland cells, and the NLCD impervious cover layer was used to correct the area of urban trees in WorldCover, which otherwise classifies any cell with &gt;10% tree cover as 100% tree.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.1: European Space Agency WorldCover\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.2: USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.3: USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) - impervious cover",

    "text": "13.3 Results\nThere is considerable variation across counties in two key components that affect natural system carbon sequestration and stock potential: total area of green spaces and the ratio of ‘natural’ to ‘urban’ green spaces. Hennepin county has the highest sequestration potential due to a high proportion of urban trees and turf grass (urban grasslands) which have high potential for rapid carbon sequestration. However, counties with more acreage of green spaces in undeveloped areas, most notably St. Croix county, have a higher stock capacity. This dichotomy illustrates that different counties curation of natural spaces may play different roles. Highly developed areas may help offset carbon emissions be providing rapid sequestration sinks in urban greenery, whereas less developed counties can provide longer term carbon sinks in natural areas with a higher capacity to continue drawing down atmospheric carbon even if future emissions approach net zero.\nTwo important caveats to these results are that (1) carbon sequestration tends to slow as natural systems mature and (2) present day natural systems exist at some intermediate level of the illustrated carbon stock potential. The former means that these approximations could be higher or lower depending on the average age of natural systems in each county (e.g. time since agricultural abandonment). The latter means that the loss of these natural systems to development or habitat instruction means that not only would the region lose carbon sinks, but a substantial amount of the stored carbon will be transferred to the atmosphere, increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.4: 2021 county natural system carbon sequestration potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.5: 2021 county natural system carbon stock potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.1 Correlation with county area\nThe expectation is that larger counties have higher carbon sequestration and storage capacities due to more acreage for green spaces; this is indeed observed.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.6: 2021 carbon stock by county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.7: 2021 carbon stock by county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n13.3.2 Regional parks\nParks play an important role in climate change resilience by protecting existing natural systems and acquiring lands for natural system restoration. The regional park system of the seven county Twin Cities region provides an excellent example of this. The following graphs show how regional parks, on a per area basis, are more efficient carbon sinks than the counties they reside in. For both sequestration and stock potential, this is in large part due to a much small proportion of non-green spaces (e.g.. impervious surfaces, agricultural lands), but stock potential in particular has a higher capacity due to a larger proportion of natural green spaces as opposed to urban green spaces. Regional parks represent 4.0% of the total land area of the seven county region, but 5.6% of its carbon sequestration potential and 7.2% of its carbon stock potential.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.8: 2021 comparison of carbon sequestration per square kilometer in counties and regional parks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13.9: 2021 comparison of carbon stock per square kilometer in counties and regional parks",

    "text": "Natural systems have the capacity to sequester carbon in biomass and soils. In order to estimate the potential, we require area estimates of different natural systems and MN specific estimates of their sequestration rates. The European Space Agency created WorldCover, a remotely sensed product that depicts land cover classifications at 10 m resolution for 2021.\nTwo important caveats are that WorldCover (1) labels any raster cell as ‘Tree’ with at least 10% tree cover, leading to potential overestimates of tree coverage particularly in urbanized areas and (2) does not distinguish between urban and non-urban natural systems. In order to address these issues, we incorporated USGS’s National Land Cover Database (NLCD).\nTo address point 1, we intersected the WorldCover data with the NLCD 2021 Impervious Surface layer, which estimates the percentage of the raster cell which is impervious. From there, we reduced the area of a WorldCover ‘Tree’ cell to the percent pervious surface (100 - % impervious).\nTo address point 2, we intersected the WorldCover data with the NLCD 2021 land cover dataset which has ‘Developed areas’ when to label WorldCover ‘Tree’ and ‘Grassland’ raster cells as ‘urban’ to distinguish forests and natural grasslands from urban trees and turf grass systems. Raster cell areas were calculated based on the 10 m resolution and their cartographic position. Raster cells were assigned to county areas by intersecting the WorldCover raster with county shape files. This land area estimation is the highest quality of data according to (Table B.2).\nThus, an ‘Urban_tree’ raster cell occurred for raster cells that were labeled as ‘Tree’ by WorldCover and ‘Developed’ by NLCD and had an estimated area of:\n\\[\\text{Area Of UrbanTree} =  \\text{CellArea} \\times \\left(1 -  \\frac{\\text{ImperviousCover}} {100}\\right) \\] The script for processing land cover data, is esa_county_land_area_cover_calc.R and requires census geography and the appropriate .tif files from WorldCover.\nIn order to determine the annual carbon sequestration rate of natural systems, we searched for region-specific estimates for each land cover type (tree, urban_tree, grassland, urban_grassland, wetland), preferring primary scientific literature where possible. Carbon sequestration rates in natural systems are non-linear through time, with highest sequestration rates in younger systems and saturated rates (i.e. net zero carbon fluxes) in mature systems. Given that our land cover approach is unable to distinguish the age of a system, we used intermediate aged system rates where available. Future research could leverage the NLCD Land Cover Change Disturbance Date to attempt to determine natural system age, though this is most likely to find loss of natural systems in our region as opposed to land use conversion to natural systems.\nAn additional consideration is that these systems have different storage potentials that are not necessarily related to their sequestration rates. For instance, turf grass systems (likely most urban_grasslands in our designation) rapidly accumulate soil carbon relative to natural grasslands but saturate by 50 years, whereas grasslands as old as 75 years continue to sequester carbon at the northern edge of our system. Additional factors affecting sequestration rates include species specific life histories, soil characteristics, and water and nutrient inputs.\nCarbon sequestration rates were multiplied by a value of 3.67 to equate a unit of carbon to a unit of CO2, representing the different in atomic weights. Sequestration rates are the third highest quality rank (Table B.2), coming predominantly from peer-reviewed journal articles.\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.1: Ecosystem sequestration rates\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand Cover Type\nMetric tons CO₂e per square kilometer per year\n\n\n\n\nGrassland (Knops and Bradley 2009)\n-125\n\n\nTree (Russell 2020)\n-329\n\n\nUrban Grassland (Phillips et al. 2023)\n-301\n\n\nUrban Tree (Nowak et al. 2013)\n-620\n\n\nWetland (Polasky and Liu 2006)\n-1,115\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 14.2: Ecosystem carbon stock potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLand Cover Type\nMetric tons CO₂e per square kilometer\n\n\n\n\nGrassland (Liu et al. 2014)\n-24,589\n\n\nTree (Liu et al. 2014)\n-45,141\n\n\nUrban Grassland (Selhorst and Lal 2013)\n-16,809\n\n\nUrban Tree (Nowak et al. 2013)\n-16,148\n\n\nWetland (Nahlik and Fennessy 2016)\n-134,138\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKnops, Johannes M.

    "text": "A.2 Global Warming Potential (GWP)\nThe Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period (USEPA 2023).\n\nAcross all sectors, we used the GWP values established in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) 6th Assessment Report (AR6), Table 7.SM.7 (IPCC 2023).
