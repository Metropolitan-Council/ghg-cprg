Stat. § 196.07, investor- and municipally owned electric utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of kWh) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Legislature, n.d.).\nOf the seven in-scope electric utilities, only three (the investor- and municipally-owned utilities) were required to make these reports to the State in 2021 (four of the in-scope electric utilities are cooperative utilities); state data was leveraged in this case. For the four utilities (all cooperative utilities) not making these reports, we relied upon the detailed data files provided by the EIA, recording the responses of utilities to the Annual Electric Power Energy Report (Form EIA-861). Two utilities (Dunn Energy Cooperative and Polk-Burnett Electric Cooperative) filled the long version of the form, and two (St. Croix Electric Cooperative and Pierce-Pepin Electric Cooperative Services) filled the short form. For our purposes, both the long and short form provided suitable activity information (total energy delivered, total customers) to allocate energy deliveries to counties in concert with Census population data, in the process outlined below.\nBecause Wisconsin utilities do not report energy deliveries at the county level, it was necessary to estimate energy deliveries by a given utility i within a particular county j. For those three utilities who reported county-level customer counts and total customer counts to the state, we estimated mWh delivered by utility i in county j by multiplying their total statewide energy deliveries (as reported to the relevant state authorities) by the proportion of their customers residing in each of our two study area counties.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\nTo calculate the estimated energy delivered by utility i in county j for the four utilities that did not report county-level customer counts, we used population figures to allocate energy deliveries to counties. We took the actual total energy delivered by utility i (as reported to the relevant federal authorities) and multiplied this by the proportion of population within each utility’s entire service area residing within county j at the 2020 decennial Census.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhDelivered_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulation_j}) \\]\nThe factor ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulationj was calculated by first spatially joining the two…. (where each polygon represents a given utility’s service terrirory within a given county) to a spatial file containing total population for Census blocks using the block centroids, and then summing This step was completed in ArcGIS Pro and brought back to R due to memory constraints in RStudio on the relevant Met Council staffer’s work machine.\nInquiries have been made…\nBecause all four “in-scope” natural gas utilities in Wisconsin are investor-owned, we were able to estimate county-wide emissions from natural gas in 2021 by first calculating the proportion of each utility customer’s residing within Pierce and St. Croix counties, and allocating that proportion of the utility’s total reported energy delivery to each county. This approach represents a divergence from our Minnesota process, which involves aggregating county-level numbers directly reported by utilities, and implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when in actuality this is likely impacted by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county (citation needed?)\n#histogram or other visualization of customer\nFor electric… justifying modeling approach (reference to mean, use of a weighted average of per-account numbers for all utilities where we have actual and estimated per-account figures.

To measure volume for commercial traffic, we used the StreetLight Index, a relative measure of traffic volume, calibrated using AADT values to result in traffic volume (StreetLight Data 2023a).\nStreetLight compares the AADT calibration values for a given zone with StreetLight’s sample size for the same zone, and creates a calibration factor to apply to the entire analysis (StreetLight Data 2023c). We generated a calibration zone set for commercial traffic by selecting road segments with both AADT and vehicle classification data in both MN and WI.\nState DOT’s operates vehicle classification stations across the state, which provide both the volume of traffic on a given road segment and the breakdown of volume by vehicle type. We obtained this breakdown using data from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021b) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2020).\n\n\nThen, we selected only the stations within the study area with observations in the last five years (2017-2021). Finally, we joined this data with Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) WisDOT (2021) road segments by station ID. The road segments sampled include multiple road functional classes and segments in all seven metro counties. All traffic sensor stations pulled were permanent, continuous monitoring sites.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: StreetLight calibration locations and values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Vehicle weight distribution at calibration points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.3.1 Vehicle classification and calibration\nStreetLight classifies commercial vehicles by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) gross vehicle weight range (GWVR) classes: where vehicles between 14,000 lbs and 26,000 lbs (Class 4 to Class 6) are considered medium-duty, and vehicles greater than 26,000 lbs (Class 7+) are heavy-duty (StreetLight Data 2023b).\nMnDOT classifies and reports vehicles weight distributions using FHWA standards, as compared with their visual vehicle classification guide [@]\nEPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES4) has their own, slightly different vehicle classification system (USEPA 2023b).\nAfter reviewing MnDOT’s visual definitions of commercial vehicles, we defined MnDOT vehicle types 4-7 as medium-duty and types 8-13 as heavy-duty. We believe this configuration aligns most closely with both StreetLight’s and MOVES4’s vehicle classifications schemes.\nHowever, vehicles falling in FHWA class 7 (&gt; 26,000 lbs, &lt; 33,000 lbs) are classified as medium duty by state DOTs, and heavy duty by StreetLight.

AADT is an estimate of the total vehicles on a road segment on any given day of the year in all directions of travel. VMT and AADT are common traffic measures and standardized across the United States.\nMnDOT and WisDOT derive VMT using traffic counts from continuous and short term traffic monitoring sites. These raw counts are adjusted by multiplying seasonal, day-of-week, and axle adjustment factors WisDOT (2023). Data is not collected for every site every year, but the data are sufficient for year-over-year comparisons.\nThese data were compiled from MnDOT and WisDOT county level reports. MnDOT provides Excel workbooks with VMT by county and route system on their website.

    "text": "12.1 MPCA SCORE\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency collects an annual inventory, SCORE, of solid waste, recycling and organics as reported by counties across the state. For this project, we used MPCA data for the nine Minnesota counties for the year 2021.\nThe SCORE data is submitted annually by solid waste staff in each county of Minnesota, as a part of Minnesota’s SCORE laws to support waste reduction and calculate the cost of managing waste and recycling. The data provided includes the total short tons of waste generated in each county within each “Method” category, described below.\n[state-level data, highest quality]\nThe data was accessed through the SCORE tool’s Tableau dashboard [ask Sam], then filtered to include only the 9-county Minnesota portion of the region studied in this report.\n\nWhat data cleaning or wrangling was completed? How did you test these processes and outputs?\nWhat version is the data? Were there other versions available? If so, why did you choose this version?\nWhat assumptions are made when we use this dataset?\nWhich subject matter expert (SME) reviewed this data?\nDescribe testing used to verify data\n\nBe sure to add a citation of this dataset to the Zotero shared library.\n\n12.1.0.1 Data distribution\nTo check if the data is reasonable, we can start by visualizing the tons of waste generated for each county, broken into categories.\nWe would expect waste from landfills to be greater than recycling in most cases, and both landfill and recycling waste to be greater than compost (or “organics”). We can see that this expectation largely holds true, with the exception of Ramsey County, where compost outstrips both recycling and landfill. Part of the explanation for this may lie in the fact that, like Hennepin and Washington, a large portion of Ramsey County’s waste is managed in Waste-to-Energy facilities rather than landfills. This is consistent with waste management strategies of the metropolitan areas within Ramsey, Hennepin and Washington counties (add citation).\nWe also note that only two counties, Chisago and Sherburne, processed waste through onsite waste processors in 2021.\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Total waste generated by county\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect that the total amount of waste generated would be generally positively correlated with county area.\nWe see that this correlation holds loosely. The one major outlier is Ramsey County, which inculdes the St. Paul metropolitan area.\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Total waste generated by county and county area\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect that counties with large populations, such as Ramsey County, would generate more waste and smaller counties would generate less.\nComparing waste generated and population, we see a strong positive correlation (the more people there are within the county, the more waste they generate).\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Total waste generated by county and county population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.1 Data characteristics\n\nWere there any missing data?

Within the management methods, “MMSW”, or “Mixed Municipal Solid Waste”, refers to garbage, organic refuse, or other solid waste aggregated for collection, while “Combined Recycling and Organics” refers to separated recyclable and composted materials, including traditional recyclables, source-separated compostable materials, and yard trimmings.\nMMSW includes the subcategories of Landfill, WTE, Onsite, and MSW Compost. Landfill is all material disposed of in a landfill. WTE, or Waste to Energy, refers to waste combusted in an energy recovery facility or incinerator. Onsite refers to [??? where is documentation on this]. MSW Compost includes [all compost separated from landfill, check]. No metropolitan counties reported any MSW Compost in the year 2021. Only Sherburne and Chisago counties reported waste managed in onsite facilities.\nCombined Recycling and Organics includes the subcategories Recycling and Organics. Organics, as compared to MSW Compost, refers to source-separated and direct compost streams. All compost data in this report comes from this category.\nAfter comparing with federal tools like the EPA’s Waste and Recycling National Overview and the expectations of a greenhouse gas inventory, we chose to summarise SCORE’s data into three categories: Landfill, Recycling, and Organics. Landfill includes, in addition to MPCA-reported Landfill data, the categories of Onsite and WTE management.\n\n12.1.2.1 Alignment with EPA Emissions Factors\nWe used emissions factors from the EPA’s Emission Factors Hub to calculate emissions based on the totals reported by the MPCA. These emissions factors come from the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model.\nWe selected for each management subcategory the emissions factor most aligned with the waste type as reported in SCORE. These emissions factors do not take into account emissions savings associated with a particular management method, for example energy savings from Waste to Energy facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 12.1:  Solid waste management classifications by data source, including\nemissions factors \n  \n    \n      MPCA Management Method\n      MPCA Method\n      Our Category\n      Emissions Factor Name\n      Emissions Factor\n    \n  \n  \n    MMSW\n\nLandfill\n\nLandfill\n\nMixed MSW Landfilled\n\n0.52\n\n    MMSW\n\nOnsite\n\nLandfill\n\nMixed MSW Landfilled\n\n0.52\n\n    MMSW\n\nWTE\n\nWaste to Energy\n\nMixed MSW Combusted\n\n0.43\n\n    MMSW\n\nMSW Compost\n\nOrganics\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n    Combined Recycling and Organics\n\nOrganics\n\nOrganics\n\nMixed Organics Composted\n\n0.17\n\n    Combined Recycling and Organics\n\nRecycling\n\nRecycling\n\nMixed Recyclables Recycled\n\n0.09\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Limitations\n\n\n12.1.4 Comparison with similar datasets\n\n\n12.1.5 Data Dictionary"

    "text": "12.3 WI Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory\nThe most recent Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory was done in 2018 by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Included in the solid waste data for this source are emissions from landfills and waste combustion, taking into account the emissions reduced by landfill gas collection for gas-to-energy use or flaring. This inventory does not, however, include emissions generated from composting or recycling.\nThe emissions for solid waste in this report were calculated using the EPA’s SIT tool, a tool designed to help states calculate greenhouse gas emissions. Default values provided by the tool were used except in the case of default Mixed Solid Waste population tonnage values, which were replaced by data from the WI state DNR’s Annual Waste Tonnage Report.\nFor 2018, the Wisconsin DNR reported 2.2 Million Metric Tons Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MMTCO2e) generated through landfilling and solid waste management.\nIn the process of analysis, this statewide estimate was disaggregated to the county level based on county population data, as detailed in [methods chapter].\n\nQuality rank (See Table B.2) Highest quality - state-level source\nHow, when, and why was the data collected?\nWhat is the raw unit of measurement?\nHow was this data accessed?

Recycling and composting data is unavailable for Wisconsin counties.\n\n\n12.3.3 Comparison to similar datasets\nThe US EPA completes yearly state-level estimates of emissions for each state, which combined sum to the totals reported in the US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory. The data for these estimates and the US inventory can be explored at the GHG Inventory Data Explorer. The EPA’s total of landfill emissions for Wisconsin for 2018 was 2.450 MMTCO2e, not far off from the Wisconsin DNR’s 2.2 MMTCO2e. The EPA’s estimate for 2021 was 2.422 MMTCO2e.\nSince the EPA completes an inventory for the entire US and its methods may not reflect the specific nuances of emissions in each state, we elected to use the data from the Wisconsin DNR for this inventory.\n\n\n12.3.4 Data Dictionary"

    "text": "12.4 Wastewater\nWe currently have three sources for wastewater emissions: the EPA state inventory and projection tool, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) emissions inventory, and Metropolitan Council Environmental Services emission estimates. Because only the EPA’s estimate extends to Wisconsin and Minnesota we are reporting those data for consistency, but explore all three below where they have geographic overlap.\nThe EPA estimate is a high-quality government dataset that models emissions using state population, biochemical oxygen demand, fraction of wastewater anaerobically digested, fraction of population on septic, estimated protein content, and biosolids used as fertilizer to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions (USEPA 2024b). These inputs are modifiable and should be explored further in the CCAP. We down-scaled the state level emission estimates to county levels by population percentage. The actual sample os unclear.\nThe EPA tool provides outputs in metric tons CO2e. We confirmed that the global warming potentials (GWP) used are from AR5 (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014). We used the most recent version of the tool released in January 2024, version 2024.1.\nWe are currently using all and only default input values provided by the EPA, though will refine these based on our knowledge of local wastewater treatment in the future.\nYou can access the EPA tool on the EPA website and the MPCA data through their Tableau Dashboard. You can also read full methodologies for MPCA (Claflin et al. 2023) and EPA (USEPA 2024a) in their respective documents.\n\n12.4.1 Data characteristics\nThere are many sources of uncertainty in these estimates due to multiple activity data inputs required for CH4 and N2O emission estimates. The EPA wastewater module does not offer guidance on quantifying these sources of uncertainty, only describing the potential sources themselves. We have not included any uncertainty estimates in our final values.\n\n\n12.4.2 Limitations\n\nIn order to have homogeneous comparisons among counties, we are relying on default EPA State Inventory Tool data which may miss particularities about how wastewater is processed in our narrower county scope.\nWe are assuming EPA default input values are appropriate representations of the 11 county MSA region and that we can scale to county levels by population given that we are estimating municipal wastewater treatment.\n\n\n\n12.4.3 Comparison with similar datasets\nThe Metropolitan Council, MPCA, and EPA source data leads to different estimates of emissions in the common seven county region. The Metropolitan Council does not process all wastewater in the seven county region. Additionally, they report CO2 emissions from combustion of stationary fuels for infrastructure used in directly processing wastewater, unlike EPA estimates which are CH4 and N2O emissions from municipal wastewater treatment of organic matter.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 12.2:  Wastewater data sources and geographic scopes \n  \n    \n      Data source\n      Geographic scope\n    \n  \n  \n    EPA GHG Inventory and Projection Tool\n\nMinnesota and Wisconsin, scaled to county population\n\n    MPCA GHG Inventory\n\nMinnesota, scaled to county population\n\n    Metropolitan Council Wastewater Emissions Estimate\n\n7-county Minnesota metro area\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe Metropolitan Council area covers most of the 7-county Twin Cities area, but no areas in Wisconsin (Metropolitan Council 2020).

    "text": "A.2 Global Warming Potential (GWP)\nThe Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period (USEPA 2023).\nAcross all sectors, we used the GWP values established in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), Box 3.2, Table 1 (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014).
