These should correlate.\nIn cases where the origin and destination counties are not adjacent, the average trip length is consistently higher than the minimum distance between the counties.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Avg. trip distance and minimum distance between counties\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would also expect that large counties will have longer trip lengths and smaller counties will have shorter trip lengths.\nComparing trip distance and county area, we see a general positive correlation (the larger the county, the longer the average trip).\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Avg. distance for trips within county and county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3 Freight\nStreetLight does not provide StreetLight Volume for 2021 commercial vehicle analyses. To measure volume for commercial traffic, we used the StreetLight Index, a relative measure of traffic volume, calibrated using AADT values to result in traffic volume (StreetLight Data 2023a).\nStreetLight compares the AADT calibration values for a given zone with StreetLight’s sample size for the same zone, and creates a calibration factor to apply to the entire analysis (StreetLight Data 2023c). We generated a calibration zone set for commercial traffic by selecting road segments with both AADT and vehicle classification data in both MN and WI.\nState DOT’s operates vehicle classification stations across the state, which provide both the volume of traffic on a given road segment and the breakdown of volume by vehicle type. We obtained this breakdown using data from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021b) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2020).\n\n\nThen, we selected only the stations within the study area with observations in the last five years (2017-2021). Finally, we joined this data with Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) WisDOT (2021) road segments by station ID. The road segments sampled include multiple road functional classes and segments in all seven metro counties. All traffic sensor stations pulled were permanent, continuous monitoring sites.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: StreetLight calibration locations and values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Vehicle weight distribution at calibration points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3.1 Vehicle classification and calibration\nStreetLight classifies commercial vehicles by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) gross vehicle weight range (GWVR) classes: where vehicles between 14,000 lbs and 26,000 lbs (Class 4 to Class 6) are considered medium-duty, and vehicles greater than 26,000 lbs (Class 7+) are heavy-duty (StreetLight Data 2023b).\nMnDOT classifies and reports vehicles weight distributions using FHWA standards, as compared with their visual vehicle classification guide [@]\nEPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES4) has their own, slightly different vehicle classification system (USEPA 2023c).\nAfter reviewing MnDOT’s visual definitions of commercial vehicles, we defined MnDOT vehicle types 4-7 as medium-duty and types 8-13 as heavy-duty. We believe this configuration aligns most closely with both StreetLight’s and MOVES4’ vehicle classifications schemes.\nHowever, vehicles falling in FHWA class 7 (&gt; 26,000 lbs, &lt; 33,000 lbs) are classified as medium duty by state DOTs, and heavy duty by StreetLight. This discrepancy is relatively small,\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 6.1:  Vehicle weight classifications by data source \n  \n    \n    \n      Gross vehicle weight rating (lbs)\n      FHWA\n      DOT\n      StreetLight\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;6000\n\nClass 1: &lt;6,000 lbs\n\nLight-duty\n\nLight-duty\n\n    10,000\n\nClass 2: 6,001-10,000lbs\n\nLight-duty\n\nLight-duty\n\n    14,000\n\nClass 3: 10,001-14,000 lbs\n\nLight-duty\n\nLight-duty\n\n    16,000\n\nClass 4: 14,001-16,000 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nMedium-duty\n\n    19,500\n\nClass 5: 16,001-19,500 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nMedium-duty\n\n    26,000\n\nClass 6: 19,501-26,000 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nMedium-duty\n\n    33,000\n\nClass 7: 26,001-33,000 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nHeavy-duty\n\n    \n33,000\n\n\nClass 8+: &gt;33,001 lbs\n\nHeavy-duty\n\nHeavy-duty\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3.2 Calibration\nFor calibration, we found the ratio of passenger/medium/heavy-duty vehicles for traffic sensors within our study areas.\nMnDOT provides AADT road segments, which align with station identification numbers.

AADT is an estimate of the total vehicles on a road segment on any given day of the year in all directions of travel. VMT and AADT are common traffic measures and standardized across the United States.\nMnDOT and WisDOT derive VMT using traffic counts from continuous and short term traffic monitoring sites. These raw counts are adjusted by multiplying seasonal, day-of-week, and axle adjustment factors WisDOT (2023). Data is not collected for every site every year, but the data are sufficient for year-over-year comparisons.\nThese data were compiled from MnDOT and WisDOT county level reports. MnDOT provides Excel workbooks with VMT by county and route system on their website. These were downloaded, filtered to include on the relevant counties, and aggregated to the county level by summing VMT by county/route system. Processing code can be found in mndot_vmt_county.R.\nWisDOT publishes PDF tables with county-level VMT.
