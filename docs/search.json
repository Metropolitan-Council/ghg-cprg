Stat. § 196.07, investor- and municipally owned electric utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of kWh) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Legislature, n.d.).\nOf the seven in-scope electric utilities, only three (the investor- and municipally-owned utilities) were required to make these reports to the State in 2021 (four of the in-scope electric utilities are cooperative utilities); state data was leveraged in this case. For the four utilities (all cooperative utilities) not making these reports, we relied upon the detailed data files provided by the EIA, recording the responses of utilities to the Annual Electric Power Energy Report (Form EIA-861). Two utilities (Dunn Energy Cooperative and Polk-Burnett Electric Cooperative) filled the long version of the form, and two (St. Croix Electric Cooperative and Pierce-Pepin Electric Cooperative Services) filled the short form. For our purposes, both the long and short form provided suitable activity information (total energy delivered, total customers) to allocate energy deliveries to counties in concert with Census population data, in the process outlined below.\nBecause Wisconsin utilities do not report energy deliveries at the county level, it was necessary to estimate energy deliveries by a given utility i within a particular county j. For those three utilities who reported county-level customer counts and total customer counts to the state, we estimated mWh delivered by utility i in county j by multiplying their total statewide energy deliveries (as reported to the relevant state authorities) by the proportion of their customers residing in each of our two study area counties.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\nTo calculate the estimated energy delivered by utility i in county j for the four utilities that did not report county-level customer counts, we used population figures to allocate energy deliveries to counties. We took the actual total energy delivered by utility i (as reported to the relevant federal authorities) and multiplied this by the proportion of population within each utility’s entire service area residing within county j at the 2020 decennial Census.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhDelivered_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulation_j}) \\]\nThe factor ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulationj was calculated by first spatially joining the two…. (where each polygon represents a given utility’s service terrirory within a given county) to a spatial file containing total population for Census blocks using the block centroids, and then summing This step was completed in ArcGIS Pro and brought back to R due to memory constraints in RStudio on the relevant Met Council staffer’s work machine.\nInquiries have been made…\nBecause all four “in-scope” natural gas utilities in Wisconsin are investor-owned, we were able to estimate county-wide emissions from natural gas in 2021 by first calculating the proportion of each utility customer’s residing within Pierce and St. Croix counties, and allocating that proportion of the utility’s total reported energy delivery to each county. This approach represents a divergence from our Minnesota process, which involves aggregating county-level numbers directly reported by utilities, and implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when in actuality this is likely impacted by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county (citation needed?)\n#histogram or other visualization of customer\nFor electric… justifying modeling approach (reference to mean, use of a weighted average of per-account numbers for all utilities where we have actual and estimated per-account figures.

    "section": "8.1 StreetLight Data",
    "text": "8.1 StreetLight Data\nStreetLight Data is a transportation analytics platform that uses aggregated location-based services (LBS) data from cell phones, GPS data, and connected vehicle data to deliver insights on travel patterns. For this project, we used StreetLight to find the volume of traffic (number of vehicles) and average trip length for passenger and commercial vehicles.\nThe Metropolitan Council used StreetLight for our 2018 inventory.\nFor ease of access, we used {streetlightR} to interact directly with the StreetLight API. {streetlightR} is an open-source R package maintained by Council staff. We also used StreetLight InSight®, an online interface for running StreetLight analyses. Our subscription to StreetLight is part of MnDOT’s transportation analysis with regional data for informed strategies program. StreetLight falls second, only behind government data sources, in the data quality table (Table B.2).\nUsing the API, we uploaded the CPRG county geography and then performed an origin-destination analysis, in which all counties were both an origin and destination. This resulted in detailed vehicle counts for traffic between and within each of the counties. The data were then pulled and cleaned for estimating passenger and commercial VMT. The data were filtered to ensure all day types and day parts were included in the VMT calculations. Analyses were configured to include all months in 2021 and the most recent metric version (R131-M129) available was used.\nAll StreetLight API operations are recorded in R scripts: stl_upload_zone_sets.R, stl_run_analyses.R, and stl_fetch_analyses.R.\n\n8.1.1 Passenger\nFor passenger data, we used StreetLight Volume - an estimate of the number of vehicles. StreetLight uses a sample of devices with location-based services (LBS) and vehicles with location technology (connected vehicle data) to model number of vehicles (StreetLight Data 2024).\nThe models that make up StreetLight Volume predict vehicle volumes by combining location-based services (LBS) and connected vehicle trips with contextual features that represent the street network, demographics, climate, and other geographic characteristics (StreetLight Data 2023a). The models are validated against data permanent traffic counters across the country, including in the study area.\nStreetLight provides a rough sample size for the entire analysis, as shown in Table 8.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.1:  StreetLight passenger travel analysis sample size \n  \n    \n      Data periods\n      Mode of travel\n      Approximate device count\n      Approximate trip count\n    \n  \n  \n    Jan 01, 2021 - Dec 31, 2021\nAll Vehicles LBS Plus - StL All Vehicles Volume\n1,038,000\n125,411,000\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.1.1 Trip length validation\nStreetLight returns not only vehicle volume, but also trip attributes, like trip length. We then use this to estimate vehicle miles traveled, by multiplying volume by average trip length for each origin-destination pair.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: StreetLight origin-destination passenger trip length matrix\n\n\n\n\n\nStreetLight also provides a rough estimation of the overall trip distance distribution. Use the widget below to find the distributions of various origin-destination pairs.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.2: StreetLight passenger trip length distribution widget\n\n\n\nSelect an origin and destination county to visualize\n\nOrigin county\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestination county\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTo test logical validity of average trip lengths, we will compare the minimum distance between each origin and destination with the average trip length. These should correlate.\nIn cases where the origin and destination counties are not adjacent, the average trip length is consistently higher than the minimum distance between the counties.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.3: Avg. trip distance and minimum distance between counties\n\n\n\n\n\nWe can also compare these distances with the observed average trip distance from the Met Council Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI). Read more about the TBI in Section 8.4.\nFigure 8.4 shows a strong positive correlation when comparing origin-destination pairs. Note that TBI origin-destination pairs with fewer than 30 observed trips were removed due to low sample size.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.4: Avg. trip distance, Travel Behavior Inventory and StreetLight\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would also expect that large counties will have longer trip lengths and smaller counties will have shorter trip lengths.\nComparing trip distance and county area, we see a general, but weak, positive correlation (the larger the county, the longer the average trip).\n\n\n\nFigure 8.5: Avg. distance for trips within county and county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2 Commercial\nStreetLight does not provide StreetLight Volume for 2021 commercial vehicle analyses. To measure volume for commercial traffic, we used the StreetLight Index, a relative measure of traffic volume, calibrated using AADT values to result in traffic volume (StreetLight Data 2023b).\nStreetLight compares the AADT calibration values for a given zone with StreetLight’s sample size for the same zone, and creates a calibration factor to apply to the entire analysis (StreetLight Data 2023d). We generated a calibration zone set for commercial traffic by selecting road segments with both AADT and vehicle classification data in both MN and WI counties within the CPRG study area. Read more about state DOT vehicle weight distribution data in Section 8.2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 8.2:  StreetLight commercial travel analysis sample size \n  \n    \n      Data periods\n      Mode of travel\n      Vehicle weight\n      Approximate device count\n      Approximate trip count\n    \n  \n  \n    Jan 01, 2021 - Dec 31, 2021\nTruck - StL Calibrated Truck Index\nMedium\nN/A\n1,514,000\n    Jan 01, 2021 - Dec 31, 2021\nTruck - StL Calibrated Truck Index\nHeavy\nN/A\n605,000\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2.1 Trip length\nStreetLight calculates trip length in the same manner as passenger trips.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.6: StreetLight origin-destination medium-duty trip length matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.7: StreetLight origin-destination heavy-duty trip length matrix\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.8: StreetLight commercial trip length distribution widget\n\n\n\nSelect an origin and destination county to visualize\n\nOrigin county\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDestination county\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.2.2 Calibration\nStreetLight classifies commercial vehicles by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) gross vehicle weight range (GWVR) classes: where vehicles between 14,000 lbs and 26,000 lbs (Class 4 to Class 6) are considered medium-duty, and vehicles greater than 26,000 lbs (Class 7+) are heavy-duty (StreetLight Data 2023c).\nEPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES4) has their own, slightly different vehicle classification system (USEPA 2023b).\nAfter reviewing MnDOT’s visual definitions of commercial vehicles, we defined MnDOT vehicle types 4-7 as medium-duty and types 8-13 as heavy-duty. We believe this configuration aligns most closely with both StreetLight’s and MOVES4’s vehicle classifications schemes.\nHowever, vehicles falling in FHWA class 7 (&gt; 26,000 lbs, &lt; 33,000 lbs) are classified as medium duty by state DOTs, and heavy duty by StreetLight. This discrepancy is relatively small, and is unlikely to heavily influence emisssions reported.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 8.3:  Vehicle weight classifications by data source \n  \n    \n      Gross vehicle weight rating (lbs)\n      FHWA\n      DOT\n      StreetLight\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;6000\nClass 1: &lt;6,000 lbs\nLight-duty\nLight-duty\n    10,000\nClass 2: 6,001-10,000lbs\nLight-duty\nLight-duty\n    14,000\nClass 3: 10,001-14,000 lbs\nLight-duty\nLight-duty\n    16,000\nClass 4: 14,001-16,000 lbs\nMedium-duty\nMedium-duty\n    19,500\nClass 5: 16,001-19,500 lbs\nMedium-duty\nMedium-duty\n    26,000\nClass 6: 19,501-26,000 lbs\nMedium-duty\nMedium-duty\n    33,000\nClass 7: 26,001-33,000 lbs\nMedium-duty\nHeavy-duty\n    &gt;33,000\nClass 8+: &gt;33,001 lbs\nHeavy-duty\nHeavy-duty\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nTo create the calibration dataset, we found the ratio of passenger/medium/heavy-duty vehicles for at traffic count stations within our study area using state DOT data. You can read more about vehicle classification data in Section 8.2.2.\n\n\n\n8.1.3 Total vehicle volume validation\nTo validate our county origin-destination VMT data, we can compare the county totals to the DOT reported values from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021a) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2021). Note that these data include all vehicle types, both passenger and commercial.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.9: County vehicle miles traveled and StreetLight Volume\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.1.4 Limitations\n\nThe data used for passenger traffic contains “all vehicles”, not just passenger vehicles, meaning that commercial vehicles may be double counted. As a default, StreetLight suggests that users use a ratio of 96/2/2 (95% passenger, 2% medium, 2% heavy). We could apply a scaling factor of 0.96 to the passenger data to account for this.\nCommercial vehicle classifications schemes differ across data sources, though the scale of this effect is unknown.\n\nSubject matter expert reviewer: ________"

    "text": "8.2 State DOT data\nAs required by federal law, Minnesota and Wisconsin state departments of transportation (MnDOT and WisDOT) report various traffic measures for planning, forecasting, and various analysis endeavors. AADT and VMT are high quality government datasets with strong validation practices.\n\n8.2.1 Vehicle miles traveled\nVehicle miles traveled (VMT) is a standardized measure created by multiplying average annual daily traffic (AADT) by centerline miles. AADT is an estimate of the total vehicles on a road segment on any given day of the year in all directions of travel. VMT and AADT are common traffic measures and standardized across the United States.\nMnDOT and WisDOT derive VMT using traffic counts from continuous and short term traffic monitoring sites. These raw counts are adjusted by multiplying seasonal, day-of-week, and axle adjustment factors WisDOT (2023). Data is not collected for every site every year, but the data are sufficient for year-over-year comparisons.\nThese data were compiled from MnDOT and WisDOT county level reports. MnDOT provides Excel workbooks with VMT by county and route system on their website. These were downloaded, filtered to include on the relevant counties, and aggregated to the county level by summing VMT by county/route system. Processing code can be found in mndot_vmt_county.R.\nWisDOT publishes PDF tables with county-level VMT. These were downloaded and data extracted using {tabulizer}, an R package interfacing with the Tabula PDF extractor library. Processing code can be found in wisdot_vmt_county.R.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.10: County vehicle miles traveled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.2 Vehicle distribution by weight\nTo calibrate the generalized StreetLight Index to get commercial vehicle counts, we created a set of spatial lines (roads) to calibrate StreetLight’s metrics. For each calibration road, we found the proportion of passenger, medium-, and heavy-duty vehicles in the most recently available year, up to 2021.\nState DOTs operate vehicle classification stations, which provide both the volume of traffic on a given road segment and, for some locations, the breakdown of volume by vehicle type. We obtained this breakdown using data from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021b) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2020) reporting websites.\nMnDOT provides AADT road segments, which align with station identification numbers. Wisconsin does not readily supply AADT road segment data - as suggested by the Wisconsin cartographers office (State Cartographer’s Office 2021), we pulled OpenStreetMaps road data (OSM version 0.6).\nThen, we selected only the stations within the study area with observations in the last five years (2017-2021). Finally, we joined this data with Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) WisDOT (2021) road segments by station ID. The road segments sampled include multiple road functional classes and segments in all counties. All traffic sensor stations pulled were permanent, continuous monitoring sites. Data were cross-validated by verifying AADT and weight distribution fields on MnDOT and WisDOT traffic mapping applications.\nData were processed in R scripts: wisdot_stations.R, mndot_extract_yearly_volume_trends.R, mndot_stations.R, calibration_lines_points.R.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.11: StreetLight calibration locations and values\n\n\n\n\n\nOnly 27 calibration roads were used for this inventory due to data availability constraints.\n\n\n\nFigure 8.12: Vehicle weight distribution at calibration points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.2.3 Limitations\n\nAADT/VMT data rely on modeling, and not every site will have new observed data every year.\nAADT/VMT are generally estimated for high-use arterials and highways, leaving local roads out.\nWe may want to consider using non-permanent counters and/or counters from just outside the study region to increase the total number of calibration roads.\n\nSubject matter expert reviewer: ________"

    "text": "8.3 EPA MOVES\nEmissions rates for our region were calculated using the EPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES4) (USEPA 2023a). MOVES4 calculates emissions factors using Council’s regional travel demand model, Minnesota Department of Vehicle Services county vehicle registration data, and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) vehicle age distribution. Each of these inputs helps the model estimate the characteristics of vehicles on the road in our region. The model takes into account differences in fuel economy (miles per gallon) depending on a vehicle’s age and size, as well as its fuel intake (diesel or gasoline). The results are specific to the conditions of our region, and so are more accurate than national averages.\n\nMOVES is a high-quality government modeling system with strong data inputs and outputs. We requested this data from our MOVES coordinator, Dennis Farmer, who ran the model and shared the resulting table with us. The model run covers [exact geographic scope here] for years [exact years here], using MOVES version [exact version here].\nThe resulting table provides grams of CO2, CH4, and N2O per vehicle mile traveled.

This may result in more inaccuracies.\nMOVES4 only accounts for vehicles that are registered in the 7-county metro area, so does not account for vehicles on regional roads, but registered elsewhere. However, the traffic generated from those vehicles is detected in the regional travel demand model.\n\nSubject matter expert reviewer: ________"

    "text": "8.4 Travel Behavior Inventory\nThe Metropolitan Council Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI) is a bi-annual household survey around 7,500 families in the 7-county Twin Cities metro and three neighboring Wisconsin counties. Information on people, households, trips, and vehicles are collected (Metropolitan Council 2021). This survey was active in the field from May 22, 2021 to February 5, 2023.\nData were imported directly from a Council-maintained public GitHub repository. The calculations below were verified from other Council analysis projects using the same dataset. Exactly 7,745 households with homes in any of the 11 CPRG counties were included in this subset of the TBI dataset.\nTBI survey statistics were processed in tbi_survey_stats.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 8.6:  2021 TBI household survey geographic distribution \n  \n    \n      Household county\n      Estimated number of households\n      Estimated number of households standard error\n      Estimated percentage of households in county\n      Estimated percentage of all households in county standard error\n      Sample size\n    \n  \n  \n    Hennepin\n506,749\n14,883\n35.10%\n0.99%\n3,573\n    Ramsey\n209,722\n9,467\n14.52%\n0.65%\n1,804\n    Dakota\n161,097\n11,679\n11.16%\n0.76%\n652\n    Outside CPRG area\n149,827\n12,223\n10.38%\n0.79%\n475\n    Anoka\n128,264\n11,620\n8.88%\n0.76%\n450\n    Washington\n94,091\n8,075\n6.52%\n0.55%\n377\n    Scott\n51,448\n7,005\n3.56%\n0.48%\n158\n    Carver\n34,501\n5,751\n2.39%\n0.39%\n139\n    St Croix\n34,456\n5,753\n2.39%\n0.39%\n108\n    Sherburne\n34,579\n5,602\n2.39%\n0.38%\n102\n    Chisago\n20,014\n4,523\n1.39%\n0.31%\n63\n    Pierce\n19,143\n4,564\n1.33%\n0.31%\n49\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.1 Regional fleet characteristics\nWe used 2021 TBI data to determine the regional average vehicle age and distribution of diesel and gasoline passenger vehicles of households in the CPRG study area.\nVehicles were classified into broad fuel categories - diesel and gas + all other fuels (including gasoline, electric, flex-fuel, hybrid, and plug-in hybrid) to best match the average miles per gallon table specifications in the EPA Local Greenhouse Gas Inventory Tool (LGGIT). The resulting value is on par with recent statistics from the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS), which calculates the average passenger vehicle age in 2021 to be 12.1 years (BTS 2023).\nTBI data were cleaned to only include vehicles with complete data and model year 1980 or later. Vehicles with a fuel type “Other (e.g., natural gas, bio-diesel)” were removed due to low sample size.\nRegional fleet statistics were processed in tbi_vehicle_stats.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 8.7:  Median vehicle age and proportion of all regional vehicles by grouped\nfuel type \n  \n    \n      Fuel type\n      Median vehicle year\n      Median vehicle year standard error\n      Estimated number of vehicles\n      Estimated number of vehicles standard error\n      Estimated percentage of all vehicles\n      Estimated percentage of all vehicles standard error\n      Sample size\n    \n  \n  \n    Gas + all other fuels\n2013\n0\n2,340,466\n62,664\n98.80%\n0.21%\n10,657\n    Diesel\n2014\n2\n28,400\n4,927\n1.20%\n0.21%\n128\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8.14: Regional vehicle fleet model year by fuel type\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n8.4.2 Average trip distance between counties\nThe average trip distance for the entire region is 6.28 miles (standard error 0.14), based on a sample of 117,870 trips.\nTrips with distance over 720 miles (the equivalent of 12 hours of driving at 60 miles per hour) were removed. Only Minnesota CPRG counties were available for analysis.\nWe used the TBI to validate StreetLight’s average trip length.

    "text": "12.2 Wastewater\nWe currently have three sources for wastewater emissions: the EPA state inventory and projection tool, the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) emissions inventory, and Metropolitan Council Environmental Services emission estimates. Because only the EPA’s estimate extends to Wisconsin and Minnesota we are reporting those data for consistency, but explore all three below where they have geographic overlap.\nThe EPA estimate is a high-quality government dataset that models emissions using state population, biochemical oxygen demand, fraction of wastewater anaerobically digested, fraction of population on septic, estimated protein content, and biosolids used as fertilizer to estimate CH4 and N2O emissions (USEPA 2024b). These inputs are modifiable and should be explored further in the CCAP. We down-scaled the state level emission estimates to county levels by population percentage. The actual sample os unclear.\nThe EPA tool provides outputs in metric tons CO2e. We confirmed that the global warming potentials (GWP) used are from AR5 (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014).

    "text": "12.1 MPCA SCORE\nThe Minnesota Pollution Control Agency collects an annual inventory, SCORE, of solid waste, recycling and organics as reported by counties across the state. For this project, we used MPCA data for the nine Minnesota counties for the year 2021.\nThe SCORE data is a high-quality government dataset submitted annually by solid waste staff in each county of Minnesota, as a part of Minnesota’s SCORE laws to support waste reduction and calculate the cost of managing waste and recycling. The data provided includes the total short tons of waste generated in each county within each “Method” category, described below.\nThe data was accessed through the SCORE tool’s Tableau dashboard, then filtered to include only the 9-county Minnesota portion of the region studied in this report.\nBe sure to add a citation of this dataset to the Zotero shared library.\n\n12.1.0.1 Data distribution\nTo check if the data is reasonable, we can start by visualizing the tons of waste generated for each county, broken into categories.\nWe would expect waste from landfills to be greater than recycling in most cases, and both landfill and recycling waste to be greater than compost (or “organics”). We can see that this expectation largely holds true, with the exception of Ramsey County, where compost outstrips both recycling and landfill.

This is consistent with waste management strategies of the metropolitan areas within Ramsey, Hennepin and Washington counties (add citation).\nWe also note that only two counties, Chisago and Sherburne, processed waste through onsite waste processors in 2021.\n\n\n\nFigure 12.1: Total waste generated by county\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect that the total amount of waste generated would be generally positively correlated with county area.\nWe see that this correlation holds loosely. The one major outlier is Ramsey County, which inculdes the St. Paul metropolitan area.\n\n\n\nFigure 12.2: Total waste generated by county and county area\n\n\n\n\n\nWe would expect that counties with large populations, such as Ramsey County, would generate more waste and smaller counties would generate less.\nComparing waste generated and population, we see a strong positive correlation (the more people there are within the county, the more waste they generate).\n\n\n\nFigure 12.3: Total waste generated by county and county population\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.1 Data characteristics\nThis data includes MSW Compost as a category, but since all values for this category in the area and year needed were 0, we excluded it from our analysis.\nUncertainty was not included in the dataset given, nor does the EPA offer guidance for estimating uncertainty of solid waste emissions factors.\n\nPlots, tables, and description of data distribution\nVariance, Z-Score, quantiles\nFacet views by categorical variables\n\n\n\n12.1.2 Waste Management Classification\nThe MPCA SCORE report classifies waste management by two management methods and, within those categories, five sub-methods. Within the management methods, “MMSW”, or “Mixed Municipal Solid Waste”, refers to garbage, organic refuse, or other solid waste aggregated for collection, while “Combined Recycling and Organics” refers to separated recyclable and composted materials, including traditional recyclables, source-separated compostable materials, and yard trimmings.\nMMSW includes the subcategories of Landfill, WTE, Onsite, and MSW Compost. Landfill is all material disposed of in a landfill. WTE, or Waste to Energy, refers to waste combusted in an energy recovery facility or incinerator. Onsite refers to [??? where is documentation on this]. MSW Compost includes [all compost separated from landfill, check]. No metropolitan counties reported any MSW Compost in the year 2021. Only Sherburne and Chisago counties reported waste managed in onsite facilities.\nCombined Recycling and Organics includes the subcategories Recycling and Organics. Organics, as compared to MSW Compost, refers to source-separated and direct compost streams. All compost data in this report comes from this category.\nAfter comparing with federal tools like the EPA’s Waste and Recycling National Overview and the expectations of a greenhouse gas inventory, we chose to summarise SCORE’s data into three categories: Landfill, Recycling, and Organics. Landfill includes, in addition to MPCA-reported Landfill data, the categories of Onsite and WTE management.\n\n12.1.2.1 Alignment with EPA Emissions Factors\nWe used emissions factors from the EPA’s Emission Factors Hub to calculate emissions based on the totals reported by the MPCA. These emissions factors come from the EPA’s Waste Reduction Model.\nWe selected for each management subcategory the emissions factor most aligned with the waste type as reported in SCORE. These emissions factors do not take into account emissions savings associated with a particular management method, for example energy savings from Waste to Energy facilities.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 12.1:  Solid waste management classifications by data source, including\nemissions factors \n  \n    \n      MPCA Management Method\n      MPCA Method\n      Our Category\n      Emissions Factor Name\n      Emissions Factor\n    \n  \n  \n    MMSW\n\nLandfill\n\nLandfill\n\nMixed MSW Landfilled\n\n0.52\n\n    MMSW\n\nOnsite\n\nLandfill\n\nMixed MSW Landfilled\n\n0.52\n\n    MMSW\n\nWTE\n\nWaste to Energy\n\nMixed MSW Combusted\n\n0.43\n\n    MMSW\n\nMSW Compost\n\nOrganics\n\nN/A\n\nN/A\n\n    Combined Recycling and Organics\n\nOrganics\n\nOrganics\n\nMixed Organics Composted\n\n0.17\n\n    Combined Recycling and Organics\n\nRecycling\n\nRecycling\n\nMixed Recyclables Recycled\n\n0.09\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n12.1.3 Limitations\n\nAs mentioned above, EPA emissions factors do not account for emissions saved through Waste to Energy conversions, as contrasted with Wisconsin emissions, which do.\nThere is wide variation between emissions factors for waste of various kinds within the same category. Because we do not have a detailed breakdown of the makeup of every category, we have assumed each one is adequately represented by the “Mixed MSW”, “Mixed Organics”, and “Mixed Recyclables” factors respectively.\nThis estimation method generates emissions for all waste generated in 2021. However, waste in landfills and composting facilities does not release all emissions at once. This method tends to overestimate emissions for a given year (cite: GHG Protocol).\n\nSubject matter expert reviewer: ___"

    "text": "12.3 WI Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory\nThe most recent Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory was done in 2018 by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Included in the solid waste data for this source are emissions from landfills and waste combustion, taking into account the emissions reduced by landfill gas collection for gas-to-energy use or flaring. This inventory does not, however, include emissions generated from composting or recycling.\nThe emissions for solid waste in this report were calculated using the EPA’s SIT tool, a tool designed to help states calculate greenhouse gas emissions. Default values provided by the tool were used except in the case of default Mixed Solid Waste population tonnage values, which were replaced by data from the WI state DNR’s Annual Waste Tonnage Report (cite inventory).\nFor 2018, the Wisconsin DNR reported 2.2 Million Metric Tons Carbon Dioxide Equivalent (MMTCO2e) generated through landfilling and solid waste management.\nIn the process of analysis, this statewide estimate was disaggregated to the county level based on county population data, as detailed in [methods chapter].\n\nQuality rank (See Table B.2) Highest quality - state-level source\nHow, when, and why was the data collected?\nWhat is the raw unit of measurement?\nHow was this data accessed?

Recycling and composting data is unavailable for Wisconsin counties.\n\n\n\n12.3.3 Comparison to similar datasets\nThe US EPA completes yearly state-level estimates of emissions for each state, which combined sum to the totals reported in the US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory. The data for these estimates and the US inventory can be explored at the GHG Inventory Data Explorer. The EPA’s total of landfill emissions for Wisconsin for 2018 was 2.450 MMTCO2e, not far off from the Wisconsin DNR’s 2.2 MMTCO2e. The EPA’s estimate for 2021 was 2.422 MMTCO2e.\nSince the EPA completes an inventory for the entire US and its methods may not reflect the specific nuances of emissions in each state, we elected to use the data from the Wisconsin DNR for this inventory."

    "text": "A.2 Global Warming Potential (GWP)\nThe Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period (USEPA 2023).\nAcross all sectors, we used the GWP values established in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fifth Assessment Report (AR5), Box 3.2, Table 1 (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014). We processed these values in global_warming_potential.R.\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table A.5:  Global Warming Potential (GWP) values \n  \n    \n      Gas\n      100-year GWP value\n      Source\n    \n  \n  \n    CO₂\n1\nIPCC AR5 (2014)\n    CH₄\n28\nIPCC AR5 (2014)\n    N₂O\n265\nIPCC AR5 (2014)\n    CF₄\n6630\nIPCC AR5 (2014)\n    HFC-152a1\n138\nIPCC AR5 (2014)\n  \n  \n  \n    \n      1 Hydrofluorocarbon-152a, Difluoroethane"

The outcome of our data collection, yielding a list of distinct utilities for which activity data should be collected, resides within distinct_natGas_util_WI.RDS (4 utilities, all investor-owned) and distinct_natGas_util_type_MN.RDS (7 utilities, six investor-owned and one municipally-owned)\n\nD.0.1 Minnesota\nSince there is no state-maintained map of natural gas service territories in Minnesota (Minnesota IT Services 2021), we looked to the Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) database, a product of the Department of Homeland Security’s Geospatial Management Office (DHS GMO) that compiles “foundation-level geospatial data” for homeland security, homeland defense, and emergency preparedness purposes. This dataset was last updated in 2017 (Department of Homeland Security 2017). Though this dataset is national in scope (see Figure D.1), it is clipped to only include utility service areas within the nine Minnesota counties included in the study area of this inventory (see Figure D.2). Note that utilities operating across county lines have a polygon covering the extent of their service territory within each and every county they operate within.\n\n\n\nFigure D.1: Nationwide utility service service territories\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure D.2: Minnesota utility service service territories in scope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nD.0.2 Wisconsin\nThe Public Service Commission of Wisconsin publishes and maintains maps of service territories for natural gas utilities operating within the state. This data set relies upon, and is accurate to, “the extent that various sources [utilities] supplied accurate data.” (Public Service Commission of Wisconsin 2021). This dataset spans the whole state of Wisconsin (see Figure D.3), and both clipped to the two Wisconsin counties included in the study area of this inventory (see Figure D.4)\nfor electric… as well as the full service territories beyond the two-county area to facilitate estimation and modeling of energy demand (see fig. Z)\nFor electric.. Because Wisconsin does not require utilities to report the amount of energy, both the extent of utilities’ operations within our study area (St. Croix and Pierce counties within Wisconsin) as well as their statewide service territories represent important inputs to our methodology for estimating both number of customer accounts and energy\n\n\n\nFigure D.3: Wisconsin utility service service territories\n\n\n\n\n\nWisconsin utilities in scope\n\n\n\nFigure D.4: Wisconsin utility service service territories in scope\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment of Homeland Security. 2017. “Natural Gas Service Territories - Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data.” https://hifld-geoplatform.opendata.arcgis.com/maps/natural-gas-service-territories.\n\n\nMinnesota IT Services. 2021. “Public Utilities Infrastructure Information for Minnesota.” https://www.mngeo.state.mn.us/chouse/utilities.html.\n\n\nPublic Service Commission of Wisconsin. 2021. “PSC Interactive Service Area Maps.” https://psc.wi.gov/Pages/ForConsumers/Maps.aspx."
