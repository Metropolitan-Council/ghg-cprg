The contents of this document do not necessarily reflect the views and policies of the EPA, nor does the EPA endorse trade names or recommend the use of commercial products mentioned in this document.\nIn 2021, the Twin-Cities MSA generated 56.29 million metric tons CO2 equivalent (MMtCO2e) emissions from the energy, transportation, industrial, waste, and agricultural sectors. Transportation was the largest contributor to GHG emissions (32.1%), followed by Industrial (24.1%), and Commercial (22.2%). Carbon sequestration from natural systems offset 4.2% of total emissions. In the methodology sector breakdown, we explain how electricity and natural gas emissions are calculated and apportioned to the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors.\nFigure 1: Regional emissions by sector and category"

SMOKE FF10 is a standardized format regularly released by the EPA for NEI, EQUATES, and Air Emissions Modeling platforms (CMAS 2024, sec. 2.2.3).\nSMOKE FF10 files were processed using read_smoke_ff10(), which reads in the raw data, records relevant metadata, filters to only include relevant counties and pollutants, and saves an intermediary dataset. These intermediary datasets are read back in, combined, and saved.\nSMOKE FF10 data were aggregated to include all MOVES processes for on- and off-network vehicle operation, including running, starting, and idling exhaust, tire and brake wear, evaporative permeation, fuel leaks, and fuel vapor venting, and crankcase exhaust (CMAS 2024, sec. 2.7.4.9). 1\n\nDirect URLs and download information are available in the EPA downloads guide.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2.1:  Intermediary datasets and processing scripts \n  \n    \n      Data source\n      Dataset\n      Processing script\n    \n  \n  \n    National Emissions Inventory\nepa_nei_smoke_ff.RDS\ndata-raw/epa_nei_smoke_ff.R\n    EQUATES\nequates_cmas_mn_wi.RDS\ndata-raw/epa_equates_read.R\n    Air Emissions Modeling\nonroad_mn_wi.RDS\ndata-raw/epa_air_emissions_modeling_onroad.R\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nEach data source and year uses a different MOVES edition.

The county-level GHG emissions included in the NEI for this category are calculated by running the MOVES model with State-, Local-, and Tribal-submitted activity data and EPA-developed activity inputs based on data from FHWA and other sources (USEPA 2023b).\nNEI data were pulled using the EnviroFacts API and processed in R scripts: epa_nei.R and epa_nei_envirofacts.R.\nNEI SMOKE FF10 data are processed in epa_nei_smoke_ff.R.\nNEI on-road regional summaries are processed in epa_nei_onroad_emissions.R.\nUltimately, NEI data used in the Metropolitan Council inventory were compiled from SMOKE FF10 for year 2020.\n\n2.3.1.1 Verification and validation\nNEI data were cross-verified by comparing county level emissions totals compiled from NEI EnviroFacts, NEI data summaries by region, and compiled SMOKE FF10.\nepa_verify_nei_envirofacts_smoke.R found that data compiled from SMOKE FF10 and regional summaries aligned exactly for year 2020 and closely for other years. Similarly, data compiled from EnviroFacts also aligned closely with SMOKE FF10 and regional summaries.\nData published on the EPA website are subject to change at any time. Every effort was taken to align versions, model runs, and other opportunities for differentiation.\n\n2.3.1.1.1 Activity data\nCompare underlying activity data with data from state DOTs\n\n\n2.3.1.1.2 Emissions factors\n\n\n\n2.3.1.2 Limitations\n\n\n\n\n2.3.2 EQUATES\n\nEQUATES (EPA’s Air QUAlity TimE Series) is a set of modeled emissions and supporting data developed by EPA scientists spanning years 2002 to 2019. EQUATES is particularly useful in that it uses modern source classification codes (SCCs) to provide a continuous time series (K. M. Foley et al. 2023).\nBetween the 2008 and 2011 NEI releases, the EPA completed major changes to their source classification codes (SCCs), which rendered direct comparison between 2008 and prior years with 2011 and later years impossible.\nEQUATES is based on the 2017 NEI and uses MOVES3 (K. M. Foley et al. 2023).\nEQUATES data are available for years 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008, 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017, 2018 and 2019.\nEQUATES SMOKE FF10 data are processed in epa_equates_read.R.\n\n2.3.2.1 Verification and validation\nThough EQUATES datasets are available on the EPA file transfer site and the CMAS Data Warehouse Google Drive, individual file names and file contents were identical.\n\n2.3.2.1.1 Activity data\nCompare underlying activity data with data from state DOTs\n\n\n2.3.2.1.2 Emissions factors\n\n\n\n2.3.2.2 Limitations\nIn addition to limitations described in Section 2.3.4, EQUATES has its own set of limitations.\n\nEQUATES does not contain emissions estimates for N2O (nitrous oxide) for years 2002-2017. N2O was added to the EPA Emissions Modeling Framework (EMF) after EQUATES was compiled. N2O does not affect air quality monitoring and so was not included in older emissions work (K. Foley, Eyth, and Allen 2024). When compared with the NEI and Air Emissions Modeling, including N2O in total CO2e resulted in a maximum difference of around 3% for some counties and years. See epa_verify_n2o_differences.R for more detail.\nEQUATES includes only on-road emission sources.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.3.3 Air Emissions Modeling Platforms\nThe EPA continually works on emissions inventories for various projects.\nAir Emissions Modeling data are available for several years, but years 2021 and 2022 are used in the final inventory.\nBoth the 2021 and 2022 estimates are based on the 2020 NEI USEPA (2024a).\nAir Emissions Modeling SMOKE FF10 data are processed in epa_air_emissions_modeling_onroad.R.\n\n2.3.3.1 Verification and validation\nAir Emissions Modeling data are only available from a single consistent website, and so verification across locations was not necessary.\n\n2.3.3.1.1 Activity data\nCompare underlying activity data with data from state DOTs\n\n\n2.3.3.1.2 Emissions factors\n\n\n\n2.3.3.2 Limitations\nIn addition to limitations described in Section 2.3.4, Air Emissions Modeling has its own set of limitations.\n\n\n\n\n2.3.4 Consistent limitations\n\nThe NEI, EQUATES, and Air Emissions Modeling platforms are based on MOVES, which does not account for activity on local roads.\nNEI, EQUATES, and Air Emissions modeling use different MOVES editions (see Table 2.3), which may result in discrepancies between years.\nTo reduce run times, the EPA uses fuel months to represent summer and winter fuels. The month of January represents October through April (winter), while July represents May through September (summer) (USEPA 2023a, sec. 5.6.6.2). Variation within the summer and winter months is not accounted for using this method.\nThe 2020 NEI had particular challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic\nMinnesota did not submit custom data inputs for the 2020 NEI, meaning that inputs to MOVES were based on national default values. Wisconsin submitted custom data for VMT, vehicle population, and road type distribution. Both Minnesota and Wisconsin submitted data for 2017, 2014, and 2011 USEPA (2015).\nThe NEI augmented vehicle miles traveled (VMT) data for Minnesota and Wisconsin in 2020 using federal and state-level datasets due to data availability issues (USEPA, Godfrey, and Eyth 2022).\nTo reduce model run-time, the EPA groups counties together and only runs MOVES on a single representative county. The resulting MOVES emissions factors are multiplied by county-specific activity data (including VMT, vehicle population, hourly speed distribution, among others) to get county-specific emissions (USEPA 2023a, sec. 5.6.2.1). Effectively, emissions factors are generated on a single representative county, and are then applied to similar counties.\n\n\n2.3.4.1 Nitrous oxide (N2O) availability\nThough nitrous oxide N2O has a high global warming potential (Section A.2), the amount of N2O released is relatively small when compared to other sectors.\nN2O is unavailable in EQUATES, except years 2018 and 2019."

    "text": "2.4 State DOT data\nAs required by federal law, Minnesota and Wisconsin state departments of transportation (MnDOT and WisDOT) report various traffic measures for planning, forecasting, and various analysis endeavors.\n\n2.4.1 Vehicle miles traveled\nVehicle miles traveled (VMT) is a standardized measure created by multiplying average annual daily traffic (AADT) by centerline miles. AADT is an estimate of the total vehicles on a road segment on any given day of the year in all directions of travel. VMT and AADT are common traffic measures and standardized across the United States.\nMnDOT and WisDOT derive VMT using traffic counts from continuous and short term traffic monitoring sites. These raw counts are adjusted by multiplying seasonal, day-of-week, and axle adjustment factors WisDOT (2023). Data is not collected for every site every year, but the data are sufficient for year-over-year comparisons.\n\n2.4.1.1 County vehicle miles traveled\nWe consider county-level data to be of the highest quality and most reliable measure of VMT.\nThese data were compiled from MnDOT and WisDOT county level reports. MnDOT provides Excel workbooks with VMT by county and route system on their website. These were downloaded, filtered to include the relevant counties, and aggregated to the county level by summing VMT by county/route system. Processing code can be found in mndot_vmt_county.R.\nVMT data for 2015 were interpolated at the county and year level using the midpoint method.[^ MnDOT VMT for year 2015 is unavailable due to significant and fundamental changes in underlying data structure that make directly comparing data prior- and post-2015 inappropriate. However, our interpolation here is based on the county level summary of all VMT and use for comparison purposes only. We used the midpoint method, which is the average of the observation directly before and directly after the missing data point.]\nWisDOT publishes PDF tables with county-level VMT. These were downloaded and data was extracted using {tabulapdf}, an R package interfacing with the Tabula PDF extractor library. Processing code can be found in wisdot_vmt_county.R.\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: County annual vehicle miles traveled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.1.2 City vehicle miles traveled\nCity VMT is available only for a select number of cities, townships, unorganized areas (CTUs).\nThese data were compiled from MnDOT city and route system reports available on their website. Reports were downloaded and aggregated at the CTU level by summing VMT up for all route systems. Processing code can be found in mndot_vmt_ctu.R.\nDue to limitations in data availability and consistency, not all CTUs in the 7-county metro region are included.\n\nCTUs without reported data prior to 2014 are excluded.\nCTUs without sampled data on local route systems (including Municipal State Aid Streets) during any year from 2017-2023 are excluded. See more about route system designations in mndot_route_system.R.\n2015 data were interpolated in the same manner as the county VMT data.\nShoreview, Blaine, and West Saint Paul are split among more than one county. For some CTU/county/year combinations, only data from 2016 onward were available. For consistency in the time series, we assigned 2016 VMT data to year 2015 for these CTU/county combinations.\nDue to geographic data source differences, MnDOT reports a small amount of VMT invalid CTU/county combinations (i.e., Minneapolis, a Hennepin County CTU, centerline miles and VMT reported in Anoka County). We discussed these anomalies with MnDOT staff and determined this to be a non-issue. The county designations for each CTU were corrected such that summing to the CTU by the CTU name determines the total VMT for each CTU No changes to county designation were made to CTUs known to be split across multiple counties (Blaine, Chanhassen, Hastings, Saint Anthony, Shorewood, Spring Lake Park and White Bear Lake).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: City annual vehicle miles traveled\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.4.2 Limitations\n\nAADT/VMT data rely on modeling, and not every site will have new observed data every year.\nAADT/VMT are generally estimated for high-use arterial roads and highways, leaving most local roads out.\nWe may want to consider using non-permanent counters and/or counters from just outside the study region to increase the total number of calibration roads."

Fuel distribution at the airport is the most straight-forward approach, as it involves applying a direct emission factor for jet fuel to the total amount of fuel distributed. As aircraft are generally only fueled for one flight at a time, we are effectively capturing emissions for aircraft flights departing MSP. The assumption is that any given airport (MSP in this case), should be responsible for half of emissions for each arrival and departure, with the complementary departure/recipient airport being responsible for the other half.\nThe second data source, MAC provided emissions are also a highly useful source, with the one overlapping year (2021) resulting in an almost identical emission estimate. However, because it lacks the explicit activity data, we prefer using the fuel distribution.\nThe final data source, which we used to in-fill interstitial years, 2006-2015, relies on MPCA statewide aviation emission estimates. Here, we calculated the proportion of MSP aviation emissions relative to statewide emissions, and used a time-series imputation method to fill in the interstitial years’ proportions. Then, we recalculated MSP emissions by multiplying the interpolated proportion by the statewide emission estimate. This method proved superior to directly imputing the MSP emissions between 2005 and 2016-2021 (i.e. not using the state data in any form), as those interpolations resulted in three years with MSP emission estimates exceeding the statewide emission estimate.\n\n\n\nFigure 3.1: Comparison of aviation emission interpolations"

    "text": "4.1 Introduction\nEmissions from the electricity generation sector have declined by 43.9% in the region since 2005, largely as a result of transitions in the grid towards energy sources such as wind and solar (MPCA 2023). In 2023, Minnesota Governor Walz signed a bill mandating a statewide carbon-free electricity standard by 2040. The law “establishes a standard for utilities to supply Minnesota customers with electricity generated or procured from carbon-free resources, beginning at an amount equal to 80% of retail sales for public utility customers in Minnesota in 2030 and increasing every 5 years to reach 100% for all electric utilities by 2040. The bill also requires that, by 2035, an amount equal to at least 55% of an electric utility’s total retail electric sales to customers in Minnesota must be generated or procured from eligible energy technologies.” Wisconsin has not adopted a similar carbon-free electricity standard, but a Wisconsin DNR report noted both the economic gains from such to the renewable energy economy in the state, as well as the opportunities for decarbonization (Holt 2019).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 4.1:  Grid Mix for MROW subregion of 2021 eGRID \n  \n    \n      Energy.Source\n      Percentage\n    \n  \n  \n    Coal\n39.6%\n    Oil\n0.2%\n    Gas\n10.6%\n    Other Fossil\n0.10%\n    Nuclear\n8.6%\n    Hydro\n4.4%\n    Biomass\n0.8%\n    Wind\n34.6%\n    Solar\n0.9%\n    Geothermal\n0.0%\n    Other\n0.2%\n    Unknown/Purchased Fuel\nN/A\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.1 Results\n\n\n4.1.2 2021 county and subsector breakdown\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: 2021 electricity emissions by sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.2: Baseline electricity emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n```\n\n\n\n\n\nHolt, Dominic. 2019. “Wisconsin’s Clean Energy Policies.” Government.

    "title": "5  Methods and data sources",
    "section": "5.1 Methods",
    "text": "5.1 Methods\nThe general workflow for quantifying electricity emissions is to identify all of the electric utilities that operate within our study area, collect any reporting they provide to the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin about the amount of energy delivered to all their customers (with reference to federal reporting sources where state-level reporting gaps exist), and apply EPA-provided emissions factors to the reported activity/energy deliveries to calculate estimated emissions. Methodologies for allocating utility activity reports to counties varies across MN and WI and are further described in the following section. Most inputs we use in the construction of our electricity emissions data set are of the highest quality rank (Table B.2), as they are either direct government-created data (e.g., emissions factors) or data reported to state/federal authorities (e.g., regulatory filings). However, for two Minnesota electric utilities – Elk River Municipal Utilities (Elk River Municipal Utilities 2022) and New Prague Utilities Commission (New Prague Utilities Commission 2022) – where regulatory filing data could not be sourced to quantify electricity deliveries, we referred to financial reporting documents published by the utilities.\nTotal regional emissions (Emissionsr) represents the sum of all recorded energy deliveries by utility i within county j, where i refers to each of the electric utilities operating across our region, and j refers to the eleven counties included in this inventory. Our regional total therefore represents an aggregation of electricity deliveries for all distinct utility-county records.\n\\[Emissions_r = \\Sigma (mWhDelivered_iCounty_j \\times {Emissions Factor}) \\]\nOur inventory takes a “demand-side” approach to emissions quantification and seeks to aggregate all reported delivery of energy to ALL customers served by utilities (meaning all customer types, inclusive of residential, commercial, industrial, and government accounts). This means that energy loss and use experienced by utilities in the process of energy generation and transmission, and delivery and resale to utilities operating outside of our study area, are not directly reflected in the numbers attributed to counties. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) estimates that annual electricity transmission and distribution (T&D) losses averaged about 5% of the electricity transmitted and distributed in the United States in 2018 through 2022. (Administration 2023)\nWhile our primary data collection does not include a breakout of electricity deliveries by sector, we do leverage year 2021 NREL SLOPE forecasts of electricity consumption (built from a base year of 2016 observed data) by sector (residential, commercial, industrial) at the county level to calculate modeled proportions of consumption by sector, which we then apply to our aggregate numbers to calculate estimated emissions by sector NREL (2017).\n\n5.1.1 Identifying utilities in scope\nTo identify the electric utilities that operate within our 11-county study area, we referred to maps and geospatial datasets capturing utility service areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin. To identify Wisconsin electric utilities, we downloaded the Electric Service Territory map maintained by the Wisconsin Public Service Commission (Wisconsin Public Service Commission and Tomaszewski 2024). To identify Minnesota electric utilities, we downloaded the Electric Service Territory map maintained by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission and the Minnesota IT Geospatial Information Office(Office 2023).\n\n\n5.1.2 Collecting and aggregating activity data from utilities\n\n5.1.2.1 County-level activity data\nAfter identifying which utilities operate within our study area within each state, we collect reporting submitted by these utilities to the relevant state and federal authorities and use a variety of approaches, depending on data availability, to allocate utility activity/energy deliveries to specific counties. For the state of Minnesota, we collected reports provided by all in-scope utilities for years 2014-2023. For year 2021, additional manual data collection efforts were completed to guarantee a complete data set, since reports for all in-scope utilities were unfortunately not available for all years. As needed, data for other county-years could be finalized in a similar fashion.\n\n5.1.2.1.1 Minnesota\nAll electric utilities authorized to do business in Minnesota are required to file an annual data report pursuant to MN Rules Chapter 7610. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission makes these reports searchable through an eFiling Site, and downloadable as Excel workbooks (Commerce 2005). For each utility identified in distinct_electricity_util_type_MN.RDS (a data product of minnesota_electricUtilities.R, a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Minnesota counties), we downloaded the relevant 2021 annual reports from this site (see note about Great River Energy in the previous section for caveats), except for North Branch Municipal Water and Light, which did not submit a 2021 report (we used their 2022 report as a substitution). Elk River Municipal Utilities and New Prague Utilities Commission did not file reports for 2021 or 2022, and so we used financial reports to identify their total electricity delivered; both utilities operated within only one county in our study area, which meant no estimation/allocation was necessary.\nWe wrote code to extract the county-level data reported in the report section titled “ITS DELIVERIES TO ULTIMATE CONSUMERS BY COUNTY FOR THE LAST CALENDAR YEAR” on the relevant annual data report Excel workbooks compiled into a folder directory, and created a table with three columns: county, utility, and mWh_delivered (megawatt-hours). By compiling this data for all utilities found to operate within our study area, aggregating all electricity deliveries at the county level becomes possible.\n\n\n5.1.2.1.2 Wisconsin\nAll municipal and investor-owned utilities authorized to do business in Wisconsin are required to file an annual report with financial and operational information pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 196.07. The Public Services Commission of Wisconsin makes these reports searchable through an E-Services Portal, and downloadable as either PDFs or Excel workbooks, with options to export only specific portions of the reports as spreadsheets (Public Service Commission of Wisconsin 2022). For each utility identified in distinct_electricity_util_type_WI.RDS (a data product of wisconsin_electricUtilities.R, a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Wisconsin counties), we downloaded the relevant 2021 annual reports from this site.\nA similar process was followed for the four Wisconsin cooperative utilities for which we referenced federal regulatory filings data to populate our dataset of electricity deliveries.\nBecause of the small amount of data, and the different data structures of the reports for municipally-, cooperatively-, and investor-owned utilities in Wisconsin, we hard-coded observed information into data frames rather than extracting data through a web scraper or document analyzer (see processed_wi_electricUtil_activityData.R).\n\n\n\n5.1.2.2 City-level activity data (seven-county metro in MN only)\nNo regulatory requirements in Minnesota or Wisconsin directly require utilities make city-level reports on electrical or natural gas usage data activity publicly available in a manner similar MN Rules Chapter 7610’s requirement for public county-level reporting. In alignment with climate planning statute, the Met Council is leading an effort to collect this information on behalf of cities and townships in the seven-county region as a constituent part of the greenhouse gas inventories being developed by the Council to support communities in their own local climate planning as required by state statute and Imagine 2050 minimum requirements. This data collection effort entails 1) direct processing of real, city-sector level data provided by utilities in our region, as well as 2) a series of modeling efforts geared towards addressing missingness in our city/township dataset, as well as disaggregation of coarser numbers provided by utilities (e.g., combined data for commercial/industrial sectors) into residential, commercial, and industrial numbers.\n\n5.1.2.2.1 Processing utility-provided data\nXcel, the largest electric utility in our region, publishes Community Energy Reports (Energy, n.d.) that document energy deliveries to specific communities in their service area. We gathered this data for years 2015-2022 and compiled it into the final .RDS file xcel_activityData_NREL_2015_2022_process.RDS.\nminnesota_xcelCommunityReports_electricity.R includes all data processing steps necessary to process the nearly 1000 files (one for each city-year combination) made available on the Community Energy Reports site. The function get_files identifies and extracts relevant info (e.g., city name) from all data files, while process_file reads detailed electricity consumption data from sections titled “Standard Community Report” in each Excel workbook. Key metrics, such as kilowatt-hours delivered (kWh_delivered) and utility-reported carbon emissions (util_reported_co2e), are then transformed into aggregated datasets (Xcel_activityData_2015_2023) at the utility-year-county level.\nAmbiguities in sector classifications, particularly the “Business” category, are addressed through proportional disaggregation using NREL-modeled emissions proportions. This process incorporates additional datasets, such as nrel_slope_city_emission_proportions.RDS, to allocate energy and emissions between commercial and industrial sectors. Geographic integration (i.e., disaggregating CTUs with footprint in multiple counties) is achieved using cprg_ctu and ctu_population, enabling population-based allocation of activity/utility-reported emissions to constituent COCTU units.\nFinal outputs of minnesota_xcelCommunityReports_electricity.R include clean, joined datasets (xcel_activityData_NREL_2015_2022_process.RDS) and visualizations that compare utility-reported sector proportions to modeled values. More to say here before modeling missingness section?\n\n\n\n5.1.2.3 Modeling missingness\nContent to come\n\n\n5.1.2.4 Emissions factors\nTo transform electricity deliveries (recorded in mWh) into emissions in metric tons CO2e, we referenced Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated Database (eGRID) summary data for the MROW subregion (Midwest Reliability Organization - West) (USEPA 2021).\nThis dataset provides estimates in lbs/mWh for CO2, CH4, N2O, and CO2e emissions based on MROW’s sub-regional electricity generation grid mix; converting this factor to metric tons per mWh and multiplying the county-level mWh estimates yields an estimate for CO2e. To generate this sub-regional estimate, eGRID first calculates estimated emissions at the plant level, and assigns plants to regions. By using an emissions factor that is localized, our inventory accounts for the specific grid mix in our study area (see the grid mix linked to the eGRID MROW emissions factor used in this inventory below). Per the eGRID technical guide, “the subregions were defined to limit the import and export of electricity in order to establish an aggregated area where the determined emission rates most accurately matched the generation and emissions from the plants within that subregion.”"

    "section": "5.2 Utility Activity Data",
    "text": "5.2 Utility Activity Data\n\n5.2.1 Minnesota\nUnder Minnesota Administrative Rules Chapter 7610 (Commerce 2005), utilities are required to file an annual data report that supports the identification of “emerging energy trends based on supply and demand, conservation and public health and safety factors, and to determine the level of statewide and service area needs” (Minnesota Department of Commerce 2022). This includes a report of county-level energy deliveries (reported in megawatt-hours, commonly written as mWh). Because the information is structured in this manner, electricity emissions at the county-level can be estimated as a direct function of energy deliveries to counties reported by utilities.\nOne utility operating within our study area, Great River Energy (GRE), is a non-profit wholesale electric power cooperative which provides wholesale power and delivery services to 28 Minnesota-based electric cooperatives, which collectively own GRE and provide retail electric service. They are the primary supplier of energy (&gt;99%) to the cooperative utilities operating in our study area. Though most electricity suppliers having relationships with Minnesota electric utilities do not file these annual data reports, GRE does, given their unique hybrid wholesale/transmission structure and cooperative ownership model. As a result, while we keep only GRE’s reporting in our data collection for county-level electricity deliveries, we exclude reporting from these subsidiary retail electric cooperatives, in order to avoid double counting electric deliveries. We use GRE’s reported deliveries to our 9 Minnesota study area counties as a full substitution for the deliveries of these utilities, which may represent a marginal undercount given that marginal-to-negligible amounts of energy delivered by these retail cooperatives came from other other sources, per their annual reports.\n\n\n5.2.2 Wisconsin\nUnder Wis. Stat. § 196.07, investor- and municipally-owned electric utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of kWh) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Wisconsin State Legislature 2024).\nOf the seven in-scope electric utilities, only three (the investor- and municipally-owned utilities) were required to make these reports to the State in 2021 (four of the in-scope electric utilities are cooperative utilities); state data was leveraged in this case. For the four utilities (all cooperative utilities) not making these reports, we relied upon the detailed data files provided by the EIA, recording the responses of utilities to the Annual Electric Power Energy Report (Form EIA-861), which records retail sales by utilities and power marketers (U.S. Energy Information Administration 2023). Two utilities (Dunn Energy Cooperative and Polk-Burnett Electric Cooperative) filled the long version of the form (filled by larger entities), and two (St. Croix Electric Cooperative and Pierce-Pepin Electric Cooperative Services) filled the short form (filled by smaller entities). For our purposes, both the long and short form provided suitable activity information (total energy delivered, total customers) to allocate energy deliveries to counties in concert with Census population data, in the process outlined below.\nBecause Wisconsin utilities do not report energy deliveries at the county level, it was necessary to estimate energy deliveries by a given utility i within a particular county j. For those three utilities who reported county-level customer counts and total customer counts to the state, we estimated mWh delivered by utility i in county j by multiplying their total statewide energy deliveries (as reported to the relevant state authorities) by the proportion of their customers residing in each of our two study area counties.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\nNote: This approach implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when this is influenced by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county.\nTo calculate the estimated energy delivered by utility i in county j for the four cooperatively-owned utilities that did not report county-level customer counts (i.e., did not report to the State), we used population figures to estimate/allocate reported electricity deliveries to counties. We took the actual total energy delivered by utility i across Wisconsin (as reported to the relevant federal authorities) and multiplied this by the proportion of total population within each utility’s entire service area residing within county j at the 2020 decennial Census.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhDelivered_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulation_j}) \\]\nThe factor ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulationj was calculated by spatially joining Census block centroids containing population data to 1) polygons representing the entirety of our in-scope utilities’ service areas (including areas outside of St. Croix and Pierce counties) and 2) polygons representing only the portions of these utilities’ service areas within a) St. Croix county and b) Pierce County. These utility-county service areas are calculated separately, to facilitate an informed allocation of statewide energy use to each county in turn.\n\n5.2.2.1 Correlation with related data\nWe would expect counties with higher population to have higher emissions.\n\n\n\nFigure 5.1: County population and electricity emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.2.2 Comparison with federal inventories\n\n\n5.2.2.2.1 NREL SLOPE\n\n\n\nFigure 5.2: Metropolitan Council emissions inventory v. NREL SLOPE modeled emissions\n\n\n\n\n\nThe NREL SLOPE (State and Local Planning for Energy) Platform provides yearly forecasted emissions tied to the user of electricity up to 2050 based on 2016 reported data at the county level. In comparing these figures to our own inventory, we observed that, where we estimated 0 metric tons of emissions linked to electricity deliveries in our study area in the year 2021, NREL SLOPE forecasted 355,545,687metrics tons in our study area.\n\n\n\n\n\nAdministration, U.

    "section": "",
    "text": "6.0.1 Introduction\nGreenhouse gas emissions from Minnesota homes and apartment buildings have increased 14% over the past 15 years, and natural gas use is the largest source of these emissions (MPCA 2023). Many local and state governments are evaluating policies to reduce natural gas usage, such as building electrification (when paired with decarbonization of the electric grid) and banning natural gas hookups in new construction.\n\n\n6.0.2 Methods\nThe general workflow for quantifying natural gas emissions is to identify all of the natural gas utilities that operate within our study area, collect any reporting they provide to the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin about the amount of energy delivered to all their customers, reference federal reporting sources where state-level reporting gaps exist, and apply EPA-provided emissions factors to the reported energy deliveries to calculate emissions. Methodologies for allocating utility activity reports to counties varies across MN and WI and are further described in the following section. All inputs we use in the construction of our natural gas emissions data set are of the highest quality rank (Table B.2), as they are either direct government-created data (e.g., emissions factors) or data reported to state or federal authorities (e.g., regulatory filings).\nTotal regional emissions (Emissionsr) represents the sum of all recorded energy deliveries by utility i within county j, where i refers to each of the electric utilities operating across our region, and j refers to the eleven counties included in this inventory. Our regional total therefore represents an aggregation of electricity deliveries for all distinct utility-county records within our 11 counties. Our inventory takes a “demand-side” approach to emissions quantification and seeks to aggregate all reported delivery of energy to all customers served by utilities (meaning residential, commercial, industrial, and government accounts).\n\\[Emissions_r = \\Sigma (mcfDelivered_iCounty_j \\times {Emissions Factor}) \\]\nWhile our primary data collection does not include a breakout of natural gas deliveries by sector, and represents only total natural gas deliveries, we do leverage year 2021 NREL SLOPE forecasts of natural gas consumption (built from a base year of 2016 observed data) by sector (residential, commercial, industrial) at the county level to calculate modeled proportions of consumption by sector, which we then apply to our aggregate numbers to calculate estimated emissions by sector. (Ma et al. 2019) (NREL 2017)\n\n6.0.2.1 Identifying utilities in scope\nTo identify the natural gas utilities that operate within our 11-county study area, we first referred to maps and geospatial datasets capturing utility service areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Where possible, state-maintained data sources were used, with federal sources referenced where state sources could not be accessed. To identify Wisconsin gas utilities, we downloaded the Natural Gas Service Territory map maintained by the Wisconsin Public Utilities Commission (Public Service Commission of Wisconsin 2021). Since Minnesota does not publish a state-maintained data set of natural gas service areas (Minnesota IT Services 2021), we used the Department of Homeland Security’s Natural Gas Service Territories map from its Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) portal to identify in-scope Minnesota gas utilities (Homeland Security 2017).\n\n\n6.0.2.2 Collecting and aggregating activity data from utilities\nAfter identifying which utilities operate within our study area within each state, we collected the reporting submitted by these utilities to the relevant state and federal authorities, and followed a distinct process for each state to accumulate data and then allocate energy deliveries to specific counties therein.\n\n6.0.2.2.1 Minnesota\nAll natural gas utilities authorized to do business in Minnesota are required to file an annual data report pursuant to MN Rules Chapter 7610 (Commerce 2005). The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission makes these reports searchable through an eFiling Site (Minnesota Department of Commerce 2022). For each utility identified in distinct_natGas_util_MN.RDS (a data product of minnesota_natGasUtilities.R, a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Minnesota counties), we downloaded the relevant annual reports from this site in their Excel workbook form.\nWe wrote code to extract the county-level data reported in report section “ANNUAL GAS DELIVERED TO ULTIMATE CONSUMERS BY COUNTY IN 2021” from these reports (which were compiled into a distinct folder directory for file processing), and created a table with three columns county, utility, and mcf_delivered (thousand cubic feet of natural gas delivered). By compiling this data for all utilities found to operate within our study area, aggregating all natural gas deliveries at the county level becomes possible.\n\n\n6.0.2.2.2 Wisconsin\nAll municipal and investor-owned natural gas utilities authorized to do business in Wisconsin are required to file an annual report with financial and operational information pursuant to Wis. Stat. § 196.07. The Public Services Commission of Wisconsin makes these reports searchable through an E-Services Portal, and downloadable as either PDFs or Excel workbooks, with options to export only specific portions of the reports as spreadsheets (Wisconsin State Legislature 2024). For each utility identified in distinct_natGas_util_WI.RDS (a data product of wisconsin_natGasUtilities.R, a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Wisconsin counties), we downloaded the relevant 2021 annual reports from this site.\nBecause of the small amount of data, we hard-coded observed information into data frames rather than extracting data through a web scraper or document analyzer as we did in Minnesota (see processed_wi_electricUtil_activityData.R.\n\n\n\n6.0.2.3 Emissions factors\nNatural gas energy deliveries were reported in standard cubic feet and converted into emissions in metric tons CO2e, referencing the 2021 EPA GHG Emissions Factor Hub (USEPA 2021).\n\n\n\n6.0.3 Results\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: 2021 natural gas emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: 2021 natural gas emissions by sector\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3.1 Correlation with related data\nWe would expect counties with higher population to have higher emissions.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: County population and natural gas emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.0.3.2 Comparison with other inventories\n\n6.0.3.2.1 NREL SLOPE\nThe NREL SLOPE (State and Local Planning for Energy) Platform provides yearly forecasted emissions from natural gas through 2050 based on 2016 observed/reported data at the county level. In comparing these figures to our own inventory, we observed that, where we estimated NA metric tons of emissions linked to natural gas use in our study area in the year 2021, NREL SLOPE forecasted 245,076,179 metric tons in our study area.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Metropolitan Council emissions inventory v.

Because the information is structured in this manner, natural gas emissions at the county-level can be estimated as a direct function of energy deliveries to counties reported by utilities, which is not the case in Wisconsin (some modeling and estimation is required in WI).\n\n\n7.1.2 Wisconsin\nUnder Wis. Stat. § 196.07, investor-owned natural gas utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of therms) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Wisconsin State Legislature 2024). Because all four “in-scope” natural gas utilities in Wisconsin are investor-owned, we did not have to refer to federal sources or use population figures to estimate energy deliveries. We estimated county-wide emissions from natural gas in 2021 by first calculating the proportion of each utility customer accounts that were linked to either Pierce or St. Croix counties, and allocating that proportion of the utility’s total reported energy delivery to each county. This approach represents a divergence from our Minnesota process, which involves aggregating county-level numbers directly reported by utilities, and implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when in actuality this is likely impacted by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county.\n\\[mcfDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mcfEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\n\n\n\n\n\nCommerce, Minnesota Department of. 2005.

These estimates are provided every 5 years, most recently in 2020 (US EIA 2023). The American Community Survey, curated by the US Census Bureau, provides the estimated number of households using each fuel type at more granular spatial and temporal scales, including county level estimates in 2021. Energy generation and GHG emissions from these fuels was estimated for each of the 11 counties in our 2021 inventory using these two data sources in combination. Both data sources are from federal governmental agencies, categorized as the highest rank of data quality (Table B.2).\nEIA RECS data was downloaded from their data portal. EIA surveyed 32,882 households nationally for 2020 data and provides estimated mmBtu (millions of British thermal units) generation from propane per household using that fuel at the state level and at the Midwest regional level for kerosene. ACS data was accessed using the tidycensus package in R. ACS conducted 62,778 household interviews in Minnesota in 2021 and provides county estimates of the number of households using a given fuel. Multiplying the estimated mmBtu generated per household in a given region by the county-level estimate of households using the fuel provides a county-level estimate of mmBtu generation from each of propane and kerosene and is then converting to CO2 equivalency using the EPA’s emission factors. This approach assumes energy generation per household per fuel is equal across each state (for propane) and the Midwest region (for kerosene).\n\n\n\nFigure 8.1: 2021 annual liquid stationary fuel emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUS EIA. 2023. “2020 Residential Energy Consumption Survey: Consumption and Expenditures Technical Documentation Summary.” Government.

Natural gas combustion is the most difficult class to account for, as natural gas is delivered both within and without the services of utilities. Additionally, smaller emitters are not required to report to state and federal agencies, meaning a small but potentially significant slice of industrial emissions may be missing."

County emissions vary widely and seemingly randomly due to the point source approach of industrial emissions, as opposed to the demand-side approach of electricity, residential building fuel, waste, and functionally on-road transportation. The largest example is that two oil refineries in Dakota County account for 36.1% of industrial emissions in 2021.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.1: 2021 county industrial emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.2 Baseline emissions\nRegional industrial emissions have increased by -5.1% since 2005, although emissions prior to 2011 are modeled by anchoring to MN Pollution Control Agency industrial emissions, which may or may not adequately represent metro region emissions. Emissions compared to 2011, the earliest year of federally supplied GHG data, there is a much more modest observed increase of -10.1%.\n\n\n\nFigure 9.2: Baseline industrial emissions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n9.2.3 Scaling to CTUs\nAs industrial emissions are provided as point sources, scaling to cities is already done.

MPCA data only accounts for fuel combustion, not process emissions.\nCurrently, GHGRP and MPCA data can be reliably used to avoid double-counting by avoiding emissions from Natural Gas. We can compare how subpart C (Industrial combustion) analyses compares to facilities with only subpart C FLIGHT aggregates.\nFigure 11.2: Comparison of industrial combustion emissions from FLIGHT and subpart C analysis\nMost emissions are on or sufficiently close to the one-to-one line. The exception is the Hennepin Energy Recovery Center, a waste burning facility. This requires further exploration but will be omitted in any case as waste-to-energy emissions are counted in the waste subsector.\nFigure 11.3: Comparison of industrial combustion emissions from FLIGHT and subpart C analysis\nWhen comparing subpart C analysis of fuel combustion to the EPA provided ‘stationary combustion’ category of the GHG RP, we see general agreement, with our subpart analysis appear to overpredict emissions from HERC and the large in-bounds oil refinery of the region, relative to the EPA data. As the refinery emits via hydrogen production and natural gas flaring, it is possible those emissions are otherwise categorized in GHG RP.\nGiven overall compliance between our subpart C analysis and EPA reporting, natural gas combustion can be pulled out from a subpart C analysis and compared to our estimates of utility-supplied natural gas deliveries to the industrial sector (via NREL).\nFigure 12.1: Comparison of natural gas combustion data\nFigure 12.2: Comparison of natural gas combustion data"

Our energy analysis uses a demand side approach to allocate electricity usage and natural gas combustion to residential, commercial, and industrial sectors. For electricity, this means avoiding industrial emissions that arise from electricty generation (note GHGRP and NEI already avoid counting electricity consumption at industrial facilities in their analyses). Natural gas consumption requires greater care, as combustion for industrial units (e.g. boilers) may be one of or some combination of natural gas, petroleum products, coal, or other fuel sources; additionally utility provisioning of natural gas may not account for all natural gas combustion at industrial sources. Our waste sector accounts for municipal waste emissions, though it does not inventory industrial waste processing."

In the 11-county Twin Cities MSA region, municipal waste produced 1.813329 MMTCO2e, or 3.4% of the regional total.\nMunicipal waste can broadly be divided into biogenic wastewater emissions and solid waste emissions. Our inventory accounts for industrial waste emission point sources in the industrial sector and wastewater processing emissions such as electricity and transportation in their respective sectors.

    "section": "13.1 Methods",
    "text": "13.1 Methods\nSolid waste emissions for Minnesota and Wisconsin are calculated using two different methods due to a difference in data availability.\n\n13.1.1 Minnesota\nThe previous iteration of this inventory calculated Minnesota’s solid waste emissions by multiplying activity totals by emissions factors from the EPA’s Emissions Factor Hub. This update instead uses methodologies recommended by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) (“2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories” 2006).The methodologies were selected to align with best practices for community-wide inventories using the IPCC recommendations and the guidance of the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Inventories (Fong et al. 2021).\n\n13.1.1.1 Landfill\nThe IPCC suggests two alternatives for calculating landfill emissions, a first order decay model and a methane commitment model. The first order decay model is often used for larger-scale inventories, such as the US Federal Inventory, and requires waste data going back to 1950. Given the data available and the scope of this inventory, we chose to instead use the simpler methane commitment model to calculate county-level emissions for Minnesota.\nThe methane commitment model calculates methane emissions from landfills for a given year by multiplying municipal solid waste totals by a methane generation potential and adjusting for oxidation and methane flaring,\n\\[Emissions_{CH_4} = [(MSW \\times L_0 )-rec] \\times (1 – ox) \\]\n\\(MSW\\), or the amount of municipal solid waste processed in landfills, is reported on a county level by MPCA’s SCORE report (?sec-mpca-score).\nIt is then multiplied by a methane generation potential \\(L_0\\). In some processes, the amount of methane recovered from landfills, either through methane flaring or landfill gas to energy programs, is subtracted here. Due to data concerns and best practices recommendations, we have chosen not to include methane recovery in our Minnesota emissions calculations. Learn more in Section 13.2.5.\nAfter subtracting methane recovered, emissions are multiplied by \\(1-ox\\) to account for oxidation in the landfill. Our oxidation value is assigned the IPCC default of 0.1.\n\\(L_0\\), the methane generation potential, is calculated as follows:\n\\[L_0 = MCF × DOC_f × F × 16/12 \\times DOC\\] where\n\n\\(MCF\\) = methane commitment factor. Assigned IPCC default of 0.5 for managed, semi-aerobic landfills.\n\\(DOC_f\\) = fraction of degradable organic carbon degraded. Assigned IPCC default of 0.6.\n\\(F\\) = fraction of methane in landfill gas. Assigned IPCC default of 0.5.\n\\(16/12\\) = Methane (CH4) to carbon (C) ratio (atomic weight)\n\\(DOC\\) = degradable organic carbon. Calculated based on local waste makeup data from MPCA’s 2013 Statewide Waste Characterization study, using the equation \\(DOC = ( 0.4 \\times \\text{paper/textiles}) + ( 0.17 \\times \\text{non-food organics}) + ( 0.15 \\times \\text{food waste}) + ( 0.3 \\times \\text{wood/straw})\\).\n\n\n\n13.1.1.2 Compost\nCompost produces both methane and nitrous oxide. Emissions are calculated by multiplying waste activity totals by emissions factors divided between aerobic and anaerobic digesters. Since Minnesota only has one anaerobic digester that is outside the inventory area, we assumed 0% anaerobic digestion within the inventory area (source).\n\\[Emissions_{CH_4} = MSW_{compost} \\times 10 \\times 10^{-3}\\]\n\\[Emissions_{N_2O} = MSW_{compost} \\times 0.6 \\times 10^{-3}\\]\nAs in other sections, MSW activity data comes from MPCA’s SCORE report. The emissions factors of 10 and 0.6 come from IPCC default values.\n\n\n13.1.1.3 Incineration\nSince incineration data is reported to SCORE as Waste to Energy, it is assumed that all incineration in the MSA is considered Waste to Energy.\nIncineration of waste produces CH4, CO2, and N2O emissions. However, the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories reports negligible CH4 emissions for continuous incineration facilities. \n\\[Emissions_{CO_2} = (MSW_{incinerated} \\times E_i + MSW_{onsite} \\times E_o) \\times FCC\n\\times FFC \\times 44/12\\]\n\\[Emissions_{N_2O} = MSW_{incinerated} \\times EF_{N_2O} \\times 10^{-6}\\]\nwhere:\n\n\\(MSW_{incinerated}\\) = municipal solid waste incinerated, as reported by SCORE.\n\\(E_i\\) = efficiency of combustion for incineration. Assigned IPCC default of 95%.\n\\(MSW_{onsite}\\) = municipal solid waste burned onsite, as reported by SCORE.\n\\(E_o\\) = efficiency of combustion for onsite burning. Assigned Greenhouse Gas Protocol default of 71%.\n\\(FCC\\) = fraction of carbon content in MSW. Assigned IPCC default of 40%.\n\\(FFC\\) = fraction of fossil carbon in MSW. Assigned IPCC default of 40%.\n\\(44/12\\) = Ratio of carbon dioxide (CO2) to carbon (C) by atomic weight\n\\(EF_{N_2O}\\) = aggregate N2O emission factor for MSW. Assigned GHG Protocol default of 50 g N2O/ metric tons waste for continuous and semi-continuous incinerators.\n\n\n\n13.1.1.4 City-level estimates\nGiven that the most granular solid waste data available is at the county level, waste emissions estimates are allocated to cities by population. County emissions are multiplied by the city or municipality’s share of county population.\nThis means that city-level estimates do not account for differences in waste collection programs between cities. The data may, for example, allocate organics emissions to cities that do not have organics processing programs. For this reason, we do not provide a breakdown of city-level emissions by source, and instead use only the total solid waste emissions. This should provide a relatively accurate estimate of total solid waste emissions for your community.\n\n\n13.1.1.5 Limitations\nBecause the methane commitment method for landfill emissions calculates emissions slightly differently than the IPCC-encouraged First Order Decay model, landfill results may differ slightly from sources that use First Order Decay, such as the EPA’s National Inventory and its State Inventory Tools. Both methods are accepted as valid ways to estimate solid waste emissions.\nMPCA SCORE does not report activity data for waste generated and processed by industry. \nEmissions are not calculated for waste that is recycled, as any emissions generated in the recycling process come from the energy use of the facilities or transportation and are accounted for in other sectors of this inventory.\n\n\n\n13.1.2 Wisconsin\nWisconsin emissions are calculated by interpolating and scaling down state-level data from the Wisconsin DNR (Wisconsin DNR 2021).\nThis 2021 inventory estimates landfill and waste-to-energy emissions for the years 2005 and 2018, including methane recovery offsets. In order to fill in missing years, emissions between 2005 and 2018 were linearly interpolated. Due to the small amount of change in emissions, it was assumed that emissions from 2018 to 2021 were constant. These emissions were then allocated to counties based on population."

    "text": "13.2 Data sources\n\n\n13.2.1 MPCA Waste Characterization Study\nIn 2013, the MPCA contracted with Burns & McDonnell Engineering Company, Inc. to conduct a waste characterization study of landfill waste, an update to an earlier study in the year 2000. For simplicity, we have chosen to set waste proportions equal to those 2013 values for all years in this inventory.\nThe study sampled waste makeup from six waste disposal facilities across the state and used the results to model statewide totals. More details can be found in study documentation.\nThis data is a high-quality state-level dataset.\nFor consistency, the values in this study have been compared to the IPCC default waste breakdown for North America. Relevant values were found to be consistent within 90% confidence intervals (as reported in the MPCA study), with the exception of food waste. IPCC values attribute 33.9% of landfill waste to food waste, while the 2013 report only finds that 17.8% of landfill waste is food waste. There are many possible explanations for this discrepancy, including differences in waste breakdown across the North American region and the possibility that the IPCC’s numbers reflect additional food waste processed in organics facilities, which would not be included in the MPCA study.\nDue to the fact that it is more recent and more specific to the Minnesota region, we have chosen the MPCA study as the source of truth in this case.\n\n\n\n13.2.2 Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory\nWaste emissions for Wisconsin counties were unavailable in the same detail as the MPCA data. Thus, we estimated total waste emissions based on statewide emissions estimates, allocated by population.\nThe most recent Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory was done in 2021 by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources. Included in the solid waste data for this source are emissions from landfills and waste combustion, taking into account the emissions reduced by landfill gas collection for gas-to-energy use or flaring. This inventory does not, however, include emissions generated from composting or recycling.\nThe emissions for solid waste in this report were calculated using the EPA’s State Inventory and Projection Tool, a tool designed to help states calculate greenhouse gas emissions (USEPA 2024). Default values provided by the tool were used except in the case of default Mixed Solid Waste population tonnage values, which were replaced by data from the Wisconsin state DNR Annual Waste Tonnage Report (Wisconsin DNR 2021).\nFor 2018, the Wisconsin DNR reported 2.2 million metric tons carbon dioxide equivalent (MMTCO2e) generated through landfilling and solid waste management.\nIn the process of analysis, this statewide estimate was apportioned to the county level based on county population data, as detailed in Chapter 12.\n\n\n13.2.3 Limitations\n\nSince data reported directly from the counties was unavailable for Wisconsin, the solid waste data used here reflects a disaggregation of state-level data and may not be reflective of the specific mix of waste generated by Pierce and St. Croix counties.\nData collected in Wisconsin’s emissions inventory only represents waste disposed of in landfills or waste combustion facilities, and does not include organics. Composting data is unavailable for Wisconsin counties.\n\n\n\n13.2.4 Comparison to similar datasets\nThe US EPA completes yearly state-level estimates of emissions for each state, which combined sum to the totals reported in the US Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory. The data for these estimates and the US inventory can be explored at the GHG Inventory Data Explorer. The EPA’s total of landfill emissions for Wisconsin for 2018 was 2.450 MMTCO2e, not far off from the Wisconsin DNR’s 2.2 MMTCO2e. The EPA’s estimate for 2021 was 2.422 MMTCO2e. More details can be found in Section 15.2.\nSince the EPA completes an inventory for the entire US and its methods may not reflect the specific nuances of emissions in each state, we elected to use the data from the Wisconsin DNR for this inventory.\n\n\n\n\n13.2.5 EPA Methane Recovery Data\nThe EPA generates methane flaring and landfill gas to energy data for each state as part of its State Inventory Tool for solid waste. This data is collected as part of the Landfill Methane Outreach Program.\nHowever, since this data is collected on a national level, there are potential discrepancies with state-level and especially regional breakdowns of methane recovery. Due to these concerns, we have chosen to exclude this data source from our inventory and instead use the IPCC default of 0 methane recovery. This means that our inventory may overestimate emissions from solid waste landfills."

Nitrous oxide emissions also derive from livestock via manure emissions, both in managed systems and in manure that is applied to or leaches into soils. Crop production also accounts for a large percentage of agricultural nitrous oxide emissions via synthetic fertilizer production and the biochemical processes that delivers nitrogen to soils. Efficient agricultural techniques, particularly in crop management, can reduce the amount of nitrogen entering soil and therefore the amount that is volatilized into gaseous nitrous oxide."

EPA provides an EF of 0.02 for manure on pasture soils and 1.571 is the ratio of nitrous oxide to N_2_.\nThe SIT calculates emissions by multiplying each animal population (entered in the manure management worksheet) by the rate of N excreted by animal type, provided in kg/head/year for cattle (excluding calves), and kg/1,000 kg animal mass/day for calves and all other livestock (i.e., swine, poultry, sheep, goats, and horses). For cattle (excluding calves), animal population is multiplied by the K-nitrogen excretion rate (kg/head/year) for total K-nitrogen excreted. For calves and all other livestock, animal population is multiplied by the TAM (kg), the K-nitrogen excretion rate (kg/1,000 kg animal mass/day), and 365 days per year for total K-nitrogen excreted. Next, the total K-nitrogen is disaggregated into manure handled in managed systems, manure applied as daily spread, and manure deposited directly into pastures, ranges, or paddocks, based on default percentages obtained from the U.S. Inventory (EPA 2023a). Direct emissions from manure handled in management systems and applied as daily spread is multiplied by the volatilization factor (0.8) to obtain the total unvolatilized N. Additionally, for poultry an adjustment must be made for the small portion of waste used as animal feed. For all poultry categories (i.e., layers (hens, pullets, and chickens), broilers, and turkeys), the total K-nitrogen in managed systems is multiplied by 0.958, as it is assumed that 4.2 percent of all poultry manure is used as animal feed and not applied to agricultural soils (Carpenter 1992). The total unvolatilized N is multiplied by the emission factor for direct emissions of N2O (1.0 percent) to obtain the amount of emissions in N2O-N/yr. For animal waste deposited directly onto pasture, range, and paddock the total K-nitrogen is multiplied by the percent of manure deposited on pasture, range, and paddocks and the IPCC default emission factor for direct emissions (0.02 kg N2O-N/kg N excreted) (IPCC 1997, EPA 2023a) to obtain the amount of emissions in N2O-N/yr."

We will continue using the census head count data as it’s error is likely less and it contains non-cattle animal counts.\n\n\n16.7.3 Scaling to CTUs\nIn the absence of CTU level livestock or crop production data, the ICLEI U.S. Community Protocol recommends downscaling from county data using the ratio of agricultural land in the community to agricultural land in the county. We followed this approach for downscaling county level emissions using NLCD land cover data to find the ratio of CTU agricultural land to county agricultural land. Future work should seek to downscale livestock counts and crop production (i.e. activity data) and recalculate emissions, enabling more direct reduction measure estimations for various agricultural components (e.g. changes to cattle feed additives that may reduce enteric fermentation)."

Photosynthesis is the central mechanism of this process and vegetation is therefore the focal land cover classification for quantifying the potential for regions to both sequester and store carbon. Different ecosystems have varying capacities for carbon capture and this work focuses on five broad classifications: urban trees, urban grasslands (i.e. turf grass, lawns), forests, natural grasslands, and wetlands. The distinction between tree and grassland cover in developed areas (i.e. urban) is important as despite having similar sequestration rates, urban natural systems are generally understood to have smaller storage capacities. The preservation and restoration of natural systems will be a key tool in reducing atmospheric greenhouse gases."

    "section": "15.3 Results",
    "text": "15.3 Results\nThere is considerable variation across counties in two key components that affect natural system carbon sequestration and stock potential: total area of green spaces and the ratio of ‘natural’ to ‘urban’ green spaces. For example, Chisago County features a higher proportion of green spaces in undeveloped lands compared to Hennepin County, and consequently has nearly 40% greater stock potential than Hennepin County owing to the former’s higher stock capacity in wetlands and forests. Despite this discrepencancy, Hennepin and Chisago Counties have nearly identical sequestration rates due to Hennepin County’s high proportion of urban trees and turf grass (urban grasslands) which have high potential for rapid carbon sequestration. This dichotomy illustrates that different counties curation of natural spaces may play different roles. Highly developed areas may help offset carbon emissions by providing rapid sequestration sinks in urban greenery, whereas less developed counties can provide longer term carbon sinks in natural areas with a higher capacity to continue drawing down atmospheric carbon even if future emissions approach net zero. The high stock capacity also reinforces the need for natural systems protection, as currently captured carbon would be released into the atmosphere upon development.\nTwo important caveats to these results are that (1) carbon sequestration tends to slow as natural systems mature and (2) present day natural systems exist at some intermediate level of the illustrated carbon stock potential. The former means that these approximations could be higher or lower depending on the average age of natural systems in each county (e.g. time since agricultural abandonment). The latter means that the loss of these natural systems to development or habitat instruction means that not only would the region lose carbon sinks, but a substantial amount of the stored carbon will be transferred to the atmosphere, increasing atmospheric greenhouse gases.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.3: 2021 county natural system carbon stock potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.4: 2021 county natural system carbon sequestration potential\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3.1 Correlation with county area\nThe expectation is that larger counties have higher carbon sequestration and storage capacities due to more acreage for green spaces; this is indeed observed.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.5: 2021 carbon stock by county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.6: 2021 carbon sequestration by county area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n15.3.2 Regional parks\nParks play an important role in climate change resilience by protecting existing natural systems and acquiring lands for natural system restoration. The regional park system of the seven county Twin Cities region provides an excellent example of this. The following graphs show how regional parks, on a per area basis, are more efficient carbon sinks than the counties they reside in. For both sequestration and stock potential, this is in large part due to a much small proportion of non-green spaces (e.g.. impervious surfaces, agricultural lands), but stock potential in particular has a higher capacity due to a larger proportion of natural green spaces as opposed to urban green spaces. Regional parks represent 4.0% of the total land area of the seven county region, but 5.6% of its carbon sequestration potential and 6.6% of its carbon stock potential.\n\n\n\nFigure 15.7: 2021 comparison of carbon stock per square kilometer in counties and regional parks\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15.8: 2021 comparison of carbon sequestration per square kilometer in counties and regional parks"

Updated every five years, the NLCD uses satellite imagery to classify land cover types, track land use change over time, and provide insights into urbanization, forestry, agriculture, and water resources.\nHere, we used three map products from the NLCD to develop our natural systems greenhouse gas inventory: (1) land cover type, (2) percent tree canopy cover, and (3) percent impervious surface. Starting with the land cover dataset (which includes 16 cover classes such as evergreen and deciduous forests, emergent herbaceous wetlands, and developed areas), our goal was to reclassify the land cover pixels into five new categories that distinguish between natural and urban systems: tree, urban_tree, grassland, urban_grassland, and wetland.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 16.1: USGS National Land Cover Database (NLCD) - Land Cover Types\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst, we used the land cover map to identify the region’s various natural cover types (e.g. forests, wetlands, grasslands) that fell outside of ‘Developed’ lands.

Here we are using methane emissions factors derived from the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) GHG Technical Support Document (see section on Methane from Inland Waters). Derived from a variety of peer-reviewed literature sources, the MPCA reports daily methane fluxes from lakes, rivers and streams, and reservoirs in units of lbs CH4 per acre of water surface area, which we have converted to metric tons CH4 per square kilometer of water surface area per year. Similarly to the MPCA Inventory approach, we assume natural water bodies in the seven-county region are anthropogenically disturbed (e.g. high nitrate runoff, invasive species) which raises methane emissions beyond natural rates.\nTo scale these emissions factors to the Metropolitan Statistical Area, we leveraged the USGS’s National Hydrography Dataset (NHD), a detailed geospatial dataset that maps the surface water features of the United States, including rivers, streams, lakes, and reservoirs. The NHD provides a standardized framework for analyzing water systems and their connectivity, enabling better decision-making to support water resource management, environmental studies, and emergency planning.\nWe used three map products from the NHD to develop our methane inventory for waterways: (1) NHDWaterbody, (2) NHDArea, and (3) NHDFlowlines. The NHDWaterbody map provides area-based waterways, such as lakes, ponds, and reservoirs, while the NHDArea map provides linear waterways, such as rivers and streams. The NHDFlowlines map provides the flowlines that connect the waterbodies and linear waterways.\nUsing the NHDWaterbody and NHDArea maps, we calculated the total area of waterways in each county and CTU. We then multiplied the area of each waterway type by the corresponding methane emissions factor to estimate the total methane emissions from waterways in each county and CTU. The figure below shows the total area of waterways in each county, broken down by waterway type. Lakes and ponds are the biggest emitters of methane across the region and within each individual county.\n\n\n\nFigure 17.1: Waterways area by county"

    "text": "E.2 On-road transportation accounting methods\nUltimately, any estimation framework or method will have advantages and limitations. Multiple methods may prove most useful for guiding policy decisions (Lylykangas et al. 2023). Starting from version 2.0.0 of this document, we are using a geographic VMT-based method to account for transportation emissions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKey concepts\n\n\n\nMost emissions inventories fall into two approaches\n\nTop-down approaches start with fuel consumption or sales data as a proxy for transportation activity (Fong et al. 2021). These approaches will then attempt to disaggregate by vehicle types and other identifiable fuel users. Examples include the US GHGI.\nBottom-up approaches begin with activity data, such as vehicle miles traveled or trip counts, and use additional data, like mode-share, energy intensity, and fuel factors to estimate emissions (Schipper, Fabian, and Leather 2009).\n\n\n\nPros and cons from Dünnebeil et al. (2012)\nBoth territorial and activity-induced methods are detailed as valid methods for estimating Scope 1 emissions by the GPC (Fong et al. 2021).\n\nE.2.1 Geographic\nGeographic or territorial methods account for any transportation emissions taking place within a geographic boundary, regardless of origin or destination (Fong et al. 2021).\nGeographic emissions are essential for quantifying air pollution experienced by people living in the area, but they do not give information on the logistic decisions of individuals.\nWithin the Twin Cities region, this method will show high emissions per capita in low population areas with significant vehicle traffic, such as a small town with a major freeway. The residents of the small town are not responsible for the emissions of vehicles passing through their town without stopping, but they are subject to the air pollution associated with those trips. Additionally, the city governing body cannot expect to reduce emissions from freeway traffic, as the road is out of their jurisdiction.\nMet Council researchers chose to use an activity-induced method to provide the most actionable information for jurisdictions within our region in both the recent PCAP and the 2018 Metro Climate Stats inventory.\n\n\nE.2.2 Induced activity\nInduced activity, or city-induced activity, methods remedy the responsibility gap left in geographic methods.\nActivity-induced methods estimate the emissions from trips that begin, end, or both begin and end within a given geographic boundary. All passthrough trips (those that neither begin or end in the geographic boundary, but pass through without stopping) are excluded.\nThis method most comprehensively covers the emissions caused by a given city or county (and those that live and/or work therein), thus within its area of influence (Dünnebeil et al. 2012).\nThough both geographic and activity-induced methods fulfill Scope 1 requirements (Fong et al. 2021), the resulting values are significantly different.\nUltimately, the GPC recommends the induced activity method for cities, as it provides results more suited to local policy making, though notes the geographic method as a viable alternative depending on data availability.\nHowever, the Twin Cities metropolitan area includes over 250 individual jurisdictions, with cities ranging from over 400,000 people to under 500 people. The entirety of the 11-county CPRG study area is larger than some US states.\nThe origin-destination activity method is used in regional PCAPs, including metro areas such as Santa Clara MSA (County of San Benito and County of Santa Clara 2024) and the Southern California Association of Governments (SCAG 2024).\n[^With the exception of heavy commercial vehicle traffic, which only includes trips that begin and end in the same geographic boundary]\n\n\nE.2.3 Consumption-based\nConsumption-based emissions inventories (CBEIs) are a calculation of all of the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the production, transportation, use and disposal of products and services consumed by a particular community or entity in a given time period (Broekhoff, Erickson, and Piggot 2019). CBEIs are frequently referred to as city carbon footprints. Emissions are modeled from massive datasets containing demographic, economic, and consumer information (EcoDataLab 2023).\nSeveral cities have conducted CBEIs, including Seattle, New York City, and Bristol, UK, among others Millward-Hopkins et al. (2017). CBEIs are particularly useful for comparing cities across the globe.\nConsumption-based methods require significant data access and are not easily translated into IPCC sectors or GPC Scopes. A typical CBEI would not meet the standards required for the CCAP."

We also now account for industrial and agricultural emissions.\n\nEnergy\n\nElectricity and natural gas data have utility report data for 2005 and 2013-2021\n\nElectricity and natural gas data are split into residential, commercial, and industrial per NREL modeling for all years\n\nElectricity and natural gas are now categories in the sectors residential, commercial, and industrial\n\n\nTransportation\n\nTransportation emissions are calculated using a different method; in previous versions, we used a 100/50/50 origin-destination method. Now we are using a VMT-based method.\n\nEmissions estimates from previous releases should not be directly compared with this and all future releases.\n\nTransportation emissions are compiled from EPA data sources, including the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), EPA EQUATES, and the Air Emissions Modeling Platform.\n\nBus, passenger, and commercial modes are accounted for.\n\nPreliminary aviation emissions accounted for.\n\n\nWaste\n\nSolid waste now follows IPCC guidelines instead of previous simplistic activity-EF model\n\nSolid waste emissions are apportioned to CTU by population\n\nWastewater is now calculated based off county and CTU population, instead of apportioned from state totals\n\n\nIndustrial\n\nNew sector, partially informed by previous energy work\n\nNew emissions data from state and federal point source data includes process emissions and additional fuel combustion\n\n\nAgriculture\n\nNew sector detailing emissions from livestock and crop production\n\nData sources are USDA county agriculture censuses and EPA emission factors\n\n\nNatural Systems\n\nSequestration now relies entirely on USGS NLCD model (WorldCover data removed for now)\n\nAdds freshwater emissions data following National Hydrography Database and state emission factors\n\n\nOther data\n\nCounty and CTU population data back to 2005.\n\n\nSee full changelog in GitHub release v2.0.0"
