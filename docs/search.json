Several calculations were made\n\nPassenger VMT was split between gasoline and diesel powered vehicles based on regional fleet composition in the TBI.\nPassenger vehicle age was determined from the median vehicle model year in the TBI.\nFuel consumption was calculated by dividing VMT by average vehicle miles per gallon (MPG), specific to vehicle type and fuel type. Fuel efficiency data were taken from the LGGIT tool.\n\nAll medium-duty VMT were classified as “Light Truck”, while all heavy-duty VMT were classified as “Heavy-Duty Vehicle”.\nAdditionally, commercial trucks were assumed to be year 2007, based on a 2018 report that found the average age of trucks in the US to be 14.2 years (Brusseau 2019) (2021 - 14 = 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 5.1:  Mobile data entered into LGGIT \n  \n    \n    \n      ID\n      Unit Description\n      Sector\n      Vehicle Year\n      Vehicle Type\n      Vehicle Model (optional)\n      Fuel Type\n      Fuel Consumption\n      VMT\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nPassenger Car Gasoline\nResidential\n2013\nPassenger Car\n\nGasoline\n943312920\n22733841369\n    2\nPassenger Car Diesel\nResidential\n2014\nPassenger Car\n\nDiesel\n8691265\n281596989\n    3\nMedium-duty\nCommercial/Institutional\n2007\nLight Truck\n\nDiesel\n37318257\n824733487\n    4\nHeavy-duty\nCommercial/Institutional\n2007\nHeavy-Duty Vehicle\n\nDiesel\n10186928\n132022580\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the LGGIT tool indicate a regional total of 8,891,499 metric tons CO2e, while our calculations indicate 8,756,036 metric tons CO2e.

To measure volume for commercial traffic, we used the StreetLight Index, a relative measure of traffic volume, calibrated using AADT values to result in traffic volume (StreetLight Data 2023a).\nStreetLight compares the AADT calibration values for a given zone with StreetLight’s sample size for the same zone, and creates a calibration factor to apply to the entire analysis (StreetLight Data 2023c). We generated a calibration zone set for commercial traffic by selecting road segments with both AADT and vehicle classification data in both MN and WI.\nState DOT’s operates vehicle classification stations across the state, which provide both the volume of traffic on a given road segment and the breakdown of volume by vehicle type. We obtained this breakdown using data from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021b) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2020).\n\n\nThen, we selected only the stations within the study area with observations in the last five years (2017-2021). Finally, we joined this data with Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) WisDOT (2021) road segments by station ID. The road segments sampled include multiple road functional classes and segments in all seven metro counties. All traffic sensor stations pulled were permanent, continuous monitoring sites.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: StreetLight calibration locations and values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Vehicle weight distribution at calibration points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3.1 Vehicle classification and calibration\nStreetLight classifies commercial vehicles by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) gross vehicle weight range (GWVR) classes: where vehicles between 14,000 lbs and 26,000 lbs (Class 4 to Class 6) are considered medium-duty, and vehicles greater than 26,000 lbs (Class 7+) are heavy-duty (StreetLight Data 2023b).\nMnDOT classifies and reports vehicles weight distributions using FHWA standards, as compared with their visual vehicle classification guide [@]\nEPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES4) has their own, slightly different vehicle classification system (USEPA 2023b).\nAfter reviewing MnDOT’s visual definitions of commercial vehicles, we defined MnDOT vehicle types 4-7 as medium-duty and types 8-13 as heavy-duty. We believe this configuration aligns most closely with both StreetLight’s and MOVES4’ vehicle classifications schemes.\nHowever, vehicles falling in FHWA class 7 (&gt; 26,000 lbs, &lt; 33,000 lbs) are classified as medium duty by state DOTs, and heavy duty by StreetLight. This discrepancy is relatively small,\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 6.1:  Vehicle weight classifications by data source \n  \n    \n    \n      Gross vehicle weight rating (lbs)\n      FHWA\n      DOT\n      StreetLight\n    \n  \n  \n    &lt;6000\n\nClass 1: &lt;6,000 lbs\n\nLight-duty\n\nLight-duty\n\n    10,000\n\nClass 2: 6,001-10,000lbs\n\nLight-duty\n\nLight-duty\n\n    14,000\n\nClass 3: 10,001-14,000 lbs\n\nLight-duty\n\nLight-duty\n\n    16,000\n\nClass 4: 14,001-16,000 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nMedium-duty\n\n    19,500\n\nClass 5: 16,001-19,500 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nMedium-duty\n\n    26,000\n\nClass 6: 19,501-26,000 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nMedium-duty\n\n    33,000\n\nClass 7: 26,001-33,000 lbs\n\nMedium-duty\n\nHeavy-duty\n\n    \n33,000\n\n\nClass 8+: &gt;33,001 lbs\n\nHeavy-duty\n\nHeavy-duty\n\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3.2 Calibration\nFor calibration, we found the ratio of passenger/medium/heavy-duty vehicles for traffic sensors within our study areas.\nMnDOT provides AADT road segments, which align with station identification numbers.

Each of these inputs helps the model estimate the characteristics of vehicles on the road in our region. The model takes into account differences in fuel economy (miles per gallon) depending on a vehicle’s age and size, as well as its fuel intake (diesel or gasoline). The results are specific to the conditions of our region, and so are more accurate than national averages.\nCO2 equivalence (CO2e) values are derived from global warming potential (GWP) values (IPCC and Core Writing Team 2014).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 6.3:  Emissions in grams per vehicle mile traveled by vehicle weight in the\nTwin Cities region \n  \n    \n    \n      Vehicle Weight\n      MOVES Year\n      Grams CH4 per mile\n      Grams N2O per mile\n      Grams CO2 per mile\n      Grams CO2e per mile\n    \n  \n  \n    Passenger\n2019\n0.0100\n0.0100\n353.43\n356.36\n    Medium\n2018\n0.0100\n0.0100\n473.24\n476.17\n    Heavy\n2018\n0.0206\n0.0402\n1212.36\n1223.59\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 6.4:  Grams of emissions per mile by vehicle type and fuel type \n  \n    \n    \n      Vehicle Type\n      Vehicle Year\n      Fuel Type\n      Grams CH4 per mile\n      Grams N2O per mile\n      Grams CO2 per mile\n      Grams CO2e per mile\n    \n  \n  \n    Passenger Car\n2013\nGasoline\n0.007\n0.005\n364.315\n365.733\n    Passenger Car\n2014\nDiesel\n0.030\n0.019\n315.123\n321.057\n    Light Truck\n2007\nDiesel\n0.001\n0.001\n461.991\n462.387\n    Heavy-Duty Vehicle\n2007\nDiesel\n0.009\n0.043\n787.809\n799.496\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nData source description, type\n\nQuality rank (See Table C.2)\nHow, when, and why was the data collected?\nIf this is a modeled dataset, what is the sample?\nWhat is the raw unit of measurement?\nHow was this data accessed?
