Because the information is structured in this manner, natural gas emissions at the county-level can be estimated as a direct function of energy deliveries to counties reported by utilities, which isn’t the case in Wisconsin (some modeling and estimation is required in WI).\nFor electric… great river\n#bar graph with utility county data\n#some data exists for MN customer counts… could be worthwile to calculate account level average for comparison to WI\n\n\n3.2.2 Wisconsin\nUnder Wis. Stat. § 196.07, investor- and municipally owned electric utilities operating within the state of Wisconsin must submit annual reports to the State which include an array of information related to utility finance and operations, including key figures leveraged in our data collection, such as total energy deliveries made (in units of kWh) and total number of customer accounts within each county (Legislature, n.d.).\nOf the seven in-scope electric utilities, only three (the investor- and municipally-owned utilities) were required to make these reports to the State in 2021 (four of the in-scope electric utilities are cooperative utilities); state data was leveraged in this case. For the four utilities (all cooperative utilities) not making these reports, we relied upon the detailed data files provided by the EIA, recording the responses of utilities to the Annual Electric Power Energy Report (Form EIA-861). Two utilities (Dunn Energy Cooperative and Polk-Burnett Electric Cooperative) filled the long version of the form, and two (St. Croix Electric Cooperative and Pierce-Pepin Electric Cooperative Services) filled the short form. For our purposes, both the long and short form provided suitable activity information (total energy delivered, total customers) to allocate energy deliveries to counties in concert with Census population data, in the process outlined below.\nBecause Wisconsin utilities do not report energy deliveries at the county level, it was necessary to estimate energy deliveries by a given utility i within a particular county j. For those three utilities who reported county-level customer counts and total customer counts to the state, we estimated mWh delivered by utility i in county j by multiplying their total statewide energy deliveries (as reported to the relevant state authorities) by the proportion of their customers residing in each of our two study area counties.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhEnergyDeliveries_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityCustomers_j}) \\]\nTo calculate the estimated energy delivered by utility i in county j for the four utilities that did not report county-level customer counts, we used population figures to allocate energy deliveries to counties. We took the actual total energy delivered by utility i (as reported to the relevant federal authorities) and multiplied this by the proportion of population within each utility’s entire service area residing within county j at the 2020 decennial Census.\n\\[mWhDelivered_iCounty_j =  (mWhDelivered_i \\times {ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulation_j}) \\]\nThe factor ProportionOfTotalUtilityPopulationj was calculated by first spatially joining the two…. (where each polygon represents a given utility’s service terrirory within a given county) to a spatial file containing total population for Census blocks using the block centroids, and then summing This step was completed in ArcGIS Pro and brought back to R due to memory constraints in RStudio on the relevant Met Council staffer’s work machine.\nInquiries have been made…\nBecause all four “in-scope” natural gas utilities in Wisconsin are investor-owned, we were able to estimate county-wide emissions from natural gas in 2021 by first calculating the proportion of each utility customer’s residing within Pierce and St. Croix counties, and allocating that proportion of the utility’s total reported energy delivery to each county. This approach represents a divergence from our Minnesota process, which involves aggregating county-level numbers directly reported by utilities, and implicitly assumes that customer accounts across counties within the operations of a given utility have the same average per-account demand for energy, when in actuality this is likely impacted by land-use mix and relative magnitude/scale of residential and commercial/industrial utility accounts within a given county (citation needed?)\n#histogram or other visualization of customer\nFor electric… justifying modeling approach (reference to mean, use of a weighted average of per-account numbers for all utilities where we have actual and estimated per-account figures.

These estimates are provided every 5 years, most recently in 2020 The American Community Survey curated by the US Census Bureau provides estimated number of households using each fuel type at more granular spatial and temporal scales. In combination, we are able to estimate energy generation and therefore GHG emissions from these fuels for each of the 11 counties in our 2021 inventory.\nData source description, type\n\nData is sourced from federal governmental agencies, so is categorized as the highest rank of data quality\nEIA data is estimated based on residential surveys of energy usage patterns and billing data. These estimates are provided every 5 years, most recently in 2020 (US EIA 2023).\n\nACS data is an annual survey of a subset of US households asking a large variety of questions including household fuel use. - EIA surveyed 32,882 households nationally for 2020 data. ACS conducted 62,778 household interviews in Minnesota in 2021.\n\nWe are reporting total county mmBtu (millions of British thermal units) generation from each of propane and kerosene and converting that to CO2 equivalency per the EPA’s emission factors.\nEIA RECS data was downloaded from their data portal. ACS data was accessed using the tidycensus package in R.\n\n-Data processing was fairly straight-forward. EIA provides estimated mmBtu generation from propane per household using that fuel at the state level and at the Midwest regional level for kerosene. County estimates are the estimated number of households using a given fuel within the county multiplied by the mmBtu generated per household using the fuel.\n\nWhat is the geographic and temporal scope? Did you complete any aggregation? Answered above.\nWhat version is the data? Were there other versions available? If so, why did you choose this version? EIA data is from 2020 which is the most recent estimate of mmBtu generated per household using a given fuel available. ACS data is from 2021 which matches the year of investigation for our current GHG inventory.\nWhat assumptions are made when we use this dataset?

Several calculations were made\n\nPassenger VMT was split between gasoline and diesel powered vehicles based on regional fleet composition in the Travel Behavior Inventory (TBI).\nPassenger vehicle age was determined from the median vehicle model year in the TBI.\nFuel consumption was calculated by dividing VMT by average vehicle miles per gallon (MPG), specific to vehicle type and fuel type. Fuel efficiency data were taken from the LGGIT tool.\n\nAll medium-duty VMT were classified as “Light Truck”, while all heavy-duty VMT were classified as “Heavy-Duty Vehicle”.\nAdditionally, commercial trucks were assumed to be year 2007, based on a 2018 report that found the average age of trucks in the US to be 14.2 years (Brusseau 2019) (2021 - 14 = 2007).\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n  Table 5.1:  Mobile data entered into LGGIT \n  \n    \n    \n      ID\n      Unit Description\n      Sector\n      Vehicle Year\n      Vehicle Type\n      Vehicle Model (optional)\n      Fuel Type\n      Fuel Consumption\n      VMT\n    \n  \n  \n    1\nPassenger Car Gasoline\nResidential\n2013\nPassenger Car\n\nGasoline\n943312920\n22733841369\n    2\nPassenger Car Diesel\nResidential\n2014\nPassenger Car\n\nDiesel\n8691265\n281596989\n    3\nMedium-duty\nCommercial/Institutional\n2007\nLight Truck\n\nDiesel\n37318257\n824733487\n    4\nHeavy-duty\nCommercial/Institutional\n2007\nHeavy-Duty Vehicle\n\nDiesel\n10186928\n132022580\n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n\n\nThe results from the LGGIT tool indicate a regional total of 8,891,499 metric tons CO2e, while our calculations indicate 8,756,036 metric tons CO2e.

To measure volume for commercial traffic, we used the StreetLight Index, a relative measure of traffic volume, calibrated using AADT values to result in traffic volume (StreetLight Data 2023a).\nStreetLight compares the AADT calibration values for a given zone with StreetLight’s sample size for the same zone, and creates a calibration factor to apply to the entire analysis (StreetLight Data 2023c). We generated a calibration zone set for commercial traffic by selecting road segments with both AADT and vehicle classification data in both MN and WI.\nState DOT’s operates vehicle classification stations across the state, which provide both the volume of traffic on a given road segment and the breakdown of volume by vehicle type. We obtained this breakdown using data from MnDOT (MnDOT 2021b) and WisDOT (WisDOT 2020).\n\n\nThen, we selected only the stations within the study area with observations in the last five years (2017-2021). Finally, we joined this data with Average Annual Daily Traffic (AADT) WisDOT (2021) road segments by station ID. The road segments sampled include multiple road functional classes and segments in all seven metro counties. All traffic sensor stations pulled were permanent, continuous monitoring sites.\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: StreetLight calibration locations and values\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Vehicle weight distribution at calibration points\n\n\n\n\n\n\n6.1.3.1 Vehicle classification and calibration\nStreetLight classifies commercial vehicles by Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) gross vehicle weight range (GWVR) classes: where vehicles between 14,000 lbs and 26,000 lbs (Class 4 to Class 6) are considered medium-duty, and vehicles greater than 26,000 lbs (Class 7+) are heavy-duty (StreetLight Data 2023b).\nMnDOT classifies and reports vehicles weight distributions using FHWA standards, as compared with their visual vehicle classification guide [@]\nEPA’s Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES4) has their own, slightly different vehicle classification system (USEPA 2023b).\nAfter reviewing MnDOT’s visual definitions of commercial vehicles, we defined MnDOT vehicle types 4-7 as medium-duty and types 8-13 as heavy-duty. We believe this configuration aligns most closely with both StreetLight’s and MOVES4’s vehicle classifications schemes.\nHowever, vehicles falling in FHWA class 7 (&gt; 26,000 lbs, &lt; 33,000 lbs) are classified as medium duty by state DOTs, and heavy duty by StreetLight.
