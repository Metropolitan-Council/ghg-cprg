### Introduction

Greenhouse gas emissions from Minnesota homes and apartment buildings have increased 14% over the past 15 years, and natural gas use is the largest source of these emissions [@mpcaClimateChangeTrends2023]. Many local and state governments are evaluating policies to reduce natural gas usage, such as building electrification (when paired with decarbonization of the electric grid) and banning natural gas hookups in new construction.

### Methods

The general workflow for quantifying natural gas emissions is to identify all of the natural gas utilities that operate within our study area, collect any reporting they provide to the states of Minnesota and Wisconsin about the amount of energy delivered to all their customers, reference  federal reporting sources where state-level reporting gaps exist, and apply EPA-provided emissions factors to the reported energy deliveries to calculate emissions. Methodologies for allocating utility activity reports to counties varies across MN and WI and are further described in the following section. All inputs we use in the construction of our natural gas emissions data set are of the highest quality rank, as they are either direct government-created data (e.g., emissions factors) or data reported to state or federal authorities (e.g., regulatory filings).

Total regional emissions (Emissions~r~) represents the sum of all recorded energy deliveries by utility *i* within county *j*, where *i* refers to each of the electric utilities operating across our region, and *j* refers to the eleven counties included in this inventory. Our regional total therefore represents an aggregation of electricity deliveries for all distinct utility-county records within our 11 counties. Our inventory takes a "demand-side" approach to emissions quantification and seeks to aggregate all reported delivery of energy to all customers served by utilities (meaning residential, commercial, industrial, and government accounts).

$$Emissions_r = \Sigma (mcfDelivered_iCounty_j \times {Emissions Factor}) $$

While our primary data collection does not include a breakout of natural gas deliveries by sector, and represents only *total* natural gas deliveries, we do leverage year 2021 NREL SLOPE forecasts of natural gas consumption (built from a base year of 2016 observed data) by sector (residential, commercial, industrial) at the county level to calculate modeled proportions of consumption by sector, which we then apply to our aggregate numbers to calculate estimated emissions *by sector*. [@maSectorSpecificMethodologiesSubnatonal2019] [@nrelSLOPEStateLocal2017]

#### Identifying utilities in scope

To identify the natural gas utilities that operate within our 11-county study area, we first referred to maps and geospatial datasets capturing utility service areas in Minnesota and Wisconsin. Where possible, state-maintained data sources were used, with federal sources referenced where state sources could not be accessed. To identify Wisconsin gas utilities, we downloaded the Natural Gas Service Territory map maintained by the Wisconsin Public Utilities Commission [@publicservicecommissionofwisconsinPSCInteractiveService2021]. Since Minnesota does not publish a state-maintained data set of natural gas service areas [@mnPublicUtilitiesInfrastructure2021], we used the Department of Homeland Security's Natural Gas Service Territories map from its Homeland Infrastructure Foundation-Level Data (HIFLD) portal to identify in-scope Minnesota gas utilities [@departmentofhomelandsecurityNaturalGasService2017].

#### Collecting and aggregating activity data from utilities

After identifying which utilities operate within our study area within each state, we collected the reporting submitted by these utilities to the relevant state and federal authorities, and followed a distinct process for each state to accumulate data and then allocate energy deliveries to specific counties therein.

##### Minnesota

All natural gas utilities authorized to do business in Minnesota are required to file an annual data report pursuant to MN Rules Chapter 7610 [@mndocCHAPTER7610ENERGY2005]. The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission makes these reports searchable through an [eFiling Site](https://www.edockets.state.mn.us/EFiling/edockets/searchDocuments.do?method=eDocketsResult&docketYear=22&docketNumber=19) [@minnesotadepartmentofcommerceAnnualReportingForms2022]. For each utility identified in [distinct_natGas_util_MN.RDS](data/distinct_natGas_util_type_MN.RDS) (a data product of [minnesota_natGasUtilities.R](data-raw/minnesota_natGasUtilities.R), a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Minnesota counties), we downloaded the relevant annual reports from this site in their Excel workbook form.

We wrote code to extract the county-level data reported in report section "ANNUAL GAS DELIVERED TO ULTIMATE CONSUMERS BY COUNTY IN 2021" from these reports (which were compiled into a distinct folder directory for file processing), and created a table with three columns `county`, `utility`, and `mcf_delivered` (thousand cubic feet of natural gas delivered). By compiling this data for all utilities found to operate within our study area, aggregating all natural gas deliveries at the county level becomes possible.

##### Wisconsin

All municipal and investor-owned natural gas utilities authorized to do business in Wisconsin are required to file an annual report with financial and operational information pursuant to Wis. Stat. ยง 196.07. The Public Services Commission of Wisconsin makes these reports searchable through an [E-Services Portal](https://apps.psc.wi.gov/ARS/annualReports/default.aspx), and downloadable as either PDFs or Excel workbooks, with options to export only specific portions of the reports as spreadsheets [@wisconsinstatelegChapter196Regulation2024]. For each utility identified in [distinct_natGas_util_WI.RDS](data/distinct_natGas_util_WI.RDS) (a data product of [wisconsin_natGasUtilities.R](data-raw/wisconsin_natGasUtilities.R), a script that looks for intersections between electric utility service areas and our Wisconsin counties), we downloaded the relevant 2021 annual reports from this site.

Because of the small amount of data, we hard-coded observed information into data frames rather than extracting data through a web scraper or document analyzer as we did in Minnesota (see [processed_wi_electricUtil_activityData.R](data-raw/processed_wi_electricUtil_activityData.R). 

#### Emissions factors

To transform natural gas energy deliveries into emissions in metric tons CO~2~e, we referenced 2021 EPA GHG Emissions Factor Hub figures [@usepaEmissionsFactorsGreenhouse2021]:

EPA originally reported these factors as kg (for CO~2~) and g (for CH~4~ and N~2~O) per standard cubic foot (scf), and we transformed these into units of lbs. per thousand cubic feet (commonly written as *mcf*) for our analysis, to 1) align with providing results in metric tons CO~2~e, and 2) to match the convention of Minnesota utilities, who reported their energy delivered in mcf. Wisconsin utilities reported their energy delivered in therms; we converted these to mcf during aggregation as well.

#### Comparison with other inventories

##### NREL SLOPE

```{r region-total-natural-gas}
region_total_natural_gas <- county_emissions %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  filter(source == "Natural gas") %>%
  summarize(emissions_metric_tons_co2e = sum(emissions_metric_tons_co2e)) %>%
  magrittr::extract2("emissions_metric_tons_co2e")

nrel_region_total_natural_gas <- nrel_metc_natural_gas_comp %>%
  filter(inventory_source == "NREL SLOPE") %>%
  summarize(emissions_metric_tons_co2e = sum(emissions_metric_tons_co2e)) %>%
  magrittr::extract2("emissions_metric_tons_co2e")
```

The NREL SLOPE (State and Local Planning for Energy) Platform provides yearly forecasted emissions tied to the user of natural up to 2050 based on 2016 observed/reported data at the county level. In comparing these figures to our own inventory, we observed that, where we estimated `r scales::comma(region_total_natural_gas, accuracy = 1)` metric tons of emissions linked to natural gas use in our study area in the year 2021, NREL SLOPE forecasted `r scales::comma(nrel_region_total_natural_gas, accuaracy = 1)` metric tons in our study area.
