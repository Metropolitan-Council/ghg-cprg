## v2.0.0 (February 2025) {.unnumbered}

Executive summary

- Adds temporal data back to 2005 for all sectors 
- Major data changes across all sectors 
- Addition of two new sectors, industrial and agriculture 
- Rearranging of energy sector breakout

Energy changes
- Electricity and natural gas data have utility report data for 2005 and 2013-2021
- Electricity and natural gas data are split into residential, commercial, and industrial per NREL modeling for all years
- Electricity and natural gas are now categories in the sectors residential, commercial, and industrial

Transportation changes
- Transportation emissions are calculated using a different method; in previous versions, we used a 100/50/50 origin-destination method. Now we are using an activity or VMT-based method. 
- Transportation emissions are compiled from EPA data sources, including the National Emissions Inventory (NEI), EPA EQUATES, and the Air Emissions Modeling Platform. 
- Bus, passenger, and commercial modes are accounted for. 
<!-- - Activity data (VMT) is now based on federal data sources instead of StreetLight -->
<!-- - Activity data is apportioned to cities and townships based on MnDOT VMT data where available -->
- Adds preliminary aviation emissions

Waste
- Solid waste now follows IPCC guidelines instead of previous simplistic activity-EF model
- Solid waste emissions are apportioned to CTU by population
- Wastewater is now calculated based off county and CTU population, instead of apportioned from state totals

Industrial
- New sector, partially informed by previous energy work
- New emissions data from state and federal point source data includes process emissions and additional fuel combustion

Agriculture
- New sector detailing emissions from livestock and crop production
- Data sources are USDA county agriculture censuses and EPA emission factors

Natural Systems
- Sequestration now relies entirely on USGS NLCD model (WorldCover data removed for now)
- Adds freshwater emissions data following National Hydrography Database and state emission factors

## v1.1.1 (July 2024) {.unnumbered}

Minor changes across all sectors (excluding natural systems) by updating GWP values to AR6 [@ipccAR62021].  

Additional changes

- Some energy data processing to get back to 2005 in `_energy/data-raw/MNWI_2005_CensusCrosswalk_UtilityAllocation.R`  
- Text for GWP updated @sec-gwp  
- Noted differences in LGGIT values @sec-epa-lggit-transportation  
- Re-ran transportation LGGIT comparison values. Minor change in values    
- Test values updated for EPA MOVES and GWP

## v1.1.0 (June 2024) {.unnumbered}

NEW SECTOR - Natural systems sequestration and carbon stock (@sec-natural-systems).

Natural systems sequestration and carbon stock at county level, with particular focus on regional parks. Data sources include WorldCover and USGS NLCD. Sequestration rates and carbon stock potential come from various literature as cited. Values are correlated with county area in square kilometers. 

Additional changes  

- Increment release version to 1.1.0, increment date  
- Updates R version to 4.4.0 and Quarto version to 1.4.533  
- Update renv packages to follow R 4.4.0  
- New packages FedData, terra, tidyterra, usethis, arcgislayers, dbplyr,  and various sub-dependencies  
- Start changelog section in appendix  
- Start folder structure for agriculture sector 
- Various text edits and updates, including references

## v1.0.0 (March 2024) {.unnumbered}

Initial release supporting [PCAP](https://www.metrocouncil.org/tcghginventory). Sections include 

- Stationary energy (electricity, natural gas, propane and kerosene)
