  abstract = {For many people, their most perceptible interaction with their environmental footprint is through the waste that they generate. On a daily basis people have numerous opportunities to decide whether to recycle, compost or throwaway. In many cases, such options may not be present or apparent. Even when such options are available, many lack the knowledge of how to correctly dispose of their waste, leading to contamination of valuable recycling or compost streams. Once collected, people give little thought to how their waste is treated. For Boston's waste, plastic in the disposal stream acts becomes a fossil fuel used to generate electricity. Organics in the waste stream have the potential to be used to generate valuable renewable energy, while metals and electronics can be recycled to offset virgin materials. However, challenges in global recycling markets are burdening municipalities, which are experiencing higher costs to maintain their recycling. The disposal of solid waste and wastewater both account for a large and visible anthropogenic impact on human health and the environment. In terms of climate change, landfilling of solid waste and wastewater treatment generated emissions of 131.5 Mt CO2e in 2016 or about two percent of total United States GHG emissions that year. The combustion of solid waste contributed an additional 11.0 Mt CO2e, over half of which (5.9 Mt CO2e) is attributable to the combustion of plastic [1]. In Massachusetts, the GHG emissions from landfills (0.4 Mt CO2e), waste combustion (1.2 Mt CO2e), and wastewater (0.5 Mt CO2e) accounted for about 2.7 percent of the state's gross GHG emissions in 2014 [2]. The City of Boston has begun exploring pathways to Zero Waste, a goal that seeks to systematically redesign our waste management system that can simultaneously lead to a drastic reduction in emissions from waste. The easiest way to achieve zero waste is to not generate it in the first place. This can start at the source with the decision whether or not to consume a product. This is the intent behind banning disposable items such as plastic bags that have more sustainable substitutes. When consumption occurs, products must be designed in such a way that their lifecycle impacts and waste footprint are considered. This includes making durable products, limiting the use of packaging or using organic packaging materials, taking back goods at the end of their life, and designing products to ensure compatibility with recycling systems. When reducing waste is unavoidable, efforts to increase recycling and organics diversion becomes essential for achieving zero waste. Pursuing such zero waste strategies will have impacts beyond reducing carbon emissions. First such strategies will likely reduce the cost of waste management and disposal, relieving tax payers of these burdens. Second, bag bans and packaging requirements will spur producers to use sustainable solutions and help to promote innovation in product packaging and materials design. Accelerating such a transformation will have global impacts by shifting the materials used in our lives to be more sustainable, and limit their accumulation in natural systems such as our waterways and oceans. The City of Boston's consumption and waste streams extend far beyond the city's boarders. Changes to these external systems, outside of the City's control, will have a large influence over the footprint of people and businesses in the city. Despite this large external influence, there remain a large opportunity for the City and its constituents to take action to reduce their waste and waste-GHG footprints as described below.},

Chester (2009) provides the first comprehensive environmental life-cycle assessment of not only vehicle and fuel components but also infrastructure components for automobiles, buses, commuter rail systems, and aircraft. Many processes were included for vehicles (manufacturing, active operation, inactive operation, maintenance, insurance), infrastructure (construction, operation, maintenance, parking, insurance), and fuels (production, distribution). The vehicles inventoried were sedans, pickups, SUVs, urban diesel buses, light rail (San Francisco's Muni Metro and Boston's Green Line, both electric), heavy rail (San Francisco Bay Area's BART and Caltrain), and aircraft (small, medium, and large-sized planes are disaggregated). Given the methodological framework in Chester (2009), the question of applicability of these systems to other U.S. modes, and the data availability of other modes, is extended in this study to motorcycles, light duty diesel vehicles, school buses, electric buses, Chicago commuter rail modes, and New York City commuter rail modes.},

Beloved Northwoods trees like spruce, aspen, and birch are expected to leave Minnesota over the next 80 years if we continue to change our climate. These changes are caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases (GHGs). This emissions inventory summarizes what we know about GHG emissions in Minnesota, including the major sources and trends over time. Tracking GHG emissions and identifying their sources are two important ways that state government can help Minnesotans understand our changing climate and respond accordingly. To guide our response to climate change, the State of Minnesota has developed a Climate Action Framework mn.gov/framework. The Framework identifies immediate, near-term actions to reduce climate pollution and prepare Minnesota communities for the impacts of climate change. It also sets new goals for Minnesota to reduce GHG emissions by 50\% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Analyzing Minnesota's emissions through this inventory allows us to track progress on the framework goals and focus actions for maximum impact to address climate change. This inventory documents Minnesota's GHG emissions from 2005 through 2020 and shows the impact of actions taken by individuals, organizations, and governments across Minnesota. The COVID-19 pandemic changed how Minnesotans lived and worked in 2020, further reducing emissions, but emissions were trending downward, even before the lifestyle shifts caused by the pandemic. Future years' data will show whether these are sustained trends or if some emissions bounced back when COVID-19 restrictions were eased. While there is much work ahead of Minnesota to meet our climate goals, this inventory demonstrates that collaborative action works.},

  abstract = {Grassland ecosystems cover a large portion of Earths' surface and contain substantial amounts of soil organic carbon. Previous work has established that these soil carbon stocks are sensitive to management and land use changes: grazing, species composition, and mineral nutrient availability can lead to losses or gains of soil carbon. Because of the large annual carbon fluxes into and out of grassland systems, there has been growing interest in how changes in management might shift the net balance of these flows, stemming losses from degrading grasslands or managing systems to increase soil carbon stocks (i.e., carbon sequestration). A synthesis published in 2001 assembled data from hundreds of studies to document soil carbon responses to changes in management. Here we present a new synthesis that has integrated data from the hundreds of studies published after our previous work. These new data largely confirm our earlier conclusions: improved grazing management, fertilization, sowing legumes and improved grass species, irrigation, and conversion from cultivation all tend to lead to increased soil C, at rates ranging from 0.105 to more than 1 Mg C{$\cdot$}ha-1{$\cdot$}yr-1. The new data include assessment of three new management practices: fire, silvopastoralism, and reclamation, although these studies are limited in number. The main area in which the new data are contrary to our previous synthesis is in conversion from native vegetation to grassland, where we find that across the studies the average rate of soil carbon stock change is low and not significant. The data in this synthesis confirm that improving grassland management practices and conversion from cropland to grassland improve soil carbon stocks.},

The PCAP is an initial step towards a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP) and the final planning document, an implementation status report. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) program provides funding to U.S. states, regions, territories, and tribes, to make meaningful plans to reduce green house gases (GHGs) and other harmful air pollutants. The program funds planning work to identify potential measures to reduce GHG emissions regionally, as defined in this Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) and the forthcoming Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP). The CPRG Implementation Phase will fund projects through a competitive grant process. This document, the PCAP for the HartfordEast Hartford--Middletown metropolitan statistical area (MSA), has been created by the Capitol Region Council of Governments (CRCOG) and the Lower Connecticut River Valley Council of Governments (RiverCOG). The planning area for the region comprises 60 communities and over 1.2 million residents. The region is located in the middle of the state, and contains a mix of urban, suburban and rural communities, including the state's capitol. The MSA primarily contains municipalities within CRCOG and RiverCOG with some additions from neighboring COGs (Figure 1). The PCAP is a product of: {$\bullet$} Comprehending the region's current GHG emissions through a GHG inventory prepared by the University of Massachusetts -- Amherst (UMass -- Amherst), {$\bullet$} Understanding what GHG reduction measures municipalities are currently undertaking through a series of virtual and in-person stakeholder meetings, {$\bullet$} Engaging stakeholders at the municipal, state, and local level to further develop and refine GHG reduction measures -- with a particular focus on engaging local residents in low income and disadvantaged communities (LIDACs), and {$\bullet$} Reviewing planning documents at the state, regional and local levels to see how the GHG reduction measures proposed in this document align with planning efforts and goals. The PCAP is focused on short-term, implementable GHG reduction measures that are a priority for the region. Any measure seeking EPA implementation funding must be included in the PCAP, whether the COG or a municipality submits the grant application. This PCAP highlights twelve GHG reduction measures grouped into six key sectors identified by the EPA: Electricity Generation, Transportation, Agricultural/ Natural \& Working Lands, Waste \& Materials Management, Commercial/Residential Buildings, and Industrial sectors.},

Extreme weather events, chronic heat and drought, flooding and intense wildfires are impacting everyone in Oregon. In March 2020, Governor Brown signed Executive Order 20-04, directing state agencies to take action to reduce and regulate greenhouse gas emissions toward meeting reduction goals of at least 45\% below 1990 emissions levels by 2035. Achieving these reductions requires enormous effort and investments throughout Oregon's economy and landscape. Oregon has a good start in reducing climate pollution, and the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program offers a historic opportunity to make investments that will be critical to achieving those goals. The Oregon Departments of Environmental Quality and Energy developed Oregon's Priority Climate Action Plan as part of an Environmental Protection Agency Phase I Climate Pollution Reduction Grant. The grant program is one of many funding opportunities provided in the federal Inflation Reduction Act. The EPA has stated objectives to prioritize grant funds: 1) that achieve maximum reductions in greenhouse gas emissions while driving benefits to surrounding communities, and 2) to invest in measures that are ready to receive funds to use over the next several years. Oregon has taken those objectives to heart, and that is reflected in the framework of our state's plan. This plan is not designed to address all the necessary and needed actions for emission reductions in Oregon. Instead, it has been developed to achieve the most reductions in the short term so that longer term planning, engagement, and development can be a future focus. DEQ and ODOE selected the measures in this plan to meet EPA's criteria in the implementation grant notice guidance, prioritizing greenhouse gas reductions over the next several years. This plan utilizes the work already done in Oregon by building on existing analyses, policies, and programs. This plan is also intended to guide how Oregon will engage with EPA on its Phase II Implementation Grant application that will be submitted later this year. Lastly, this plan contains Tribal priority measures in support of grant application submissions. The three main areas identified in this plan for EPA grant funding are 1) transportation, 2) residential and commercial buildings, and 3) waste and materials management.

This is referred to as the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Planning Area (Figure 1). This Priority Climate Action Plan is the first deliverable for the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program and includes a greenhouse gas inventory, a workforce planning analysis and climate pollution reduction measures, including an assessment of the positive effects the measures will have on low-income and disadvantaged communities and a review of the authority to implement the measures. Public and stakeholder engagement To ensure local community priorities were addressed, DRCOG staff convened three committees to facilitate this plan's creation --- a project management team, a  10 stakeholder steering committee and an equity subcommittee. Additionally, DRCOG staff held two virtual public meetings and used a public engagement website to gather public feedback. Greenhouse gas inventory The 2022 greenhouse gas inventory for the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Planning Area used the Global Protocol for Community Greenhouse Gas Emission Inventories, a standard framework for local and regional governments. The inventory provides a quantitative assessment of greenhouse gas emissions from human activities, enabling policymakers and local government staff to understand the sources and magnitude of contributions to climate change. The assessment serves as a baseline for developing effective strategies to reduce emissions and track progress over time. Within the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant Planning Area, transportation (34\%), commercial buildings (30\%) and residential buildings (22\%) constitute a combined 86\% of the area's emissions, depicted in Figure 4.

Please refer to our Guide to EIA Electric Power Data and send any questions to InfoElectric@eia.gov. In 2012, we created Form EIA-861S to reduce respondent burden and to increase our processing efficiency; that year, about 1,100 utilities initially reported on this form instead of Form EIA-861. In 2020, the number of utilities increased to about 1,700 utilities. We reformatted the files for the years 1990--2011, but we didn't change or update any data files. We reformatted the files to make them easier to understand and to match the format and titles of the current files.}

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

In total, there are over 86,000 buildings that comprise more than 647 million square feet of area. Most of these buildings will still be in use in 2050. Floorspace (square footage) is almost evenly split between residential and non-residential uses, but residential buildings account for nearly 80,000 (93 percent) of the 86,000 buildings. Boston's buildings are used for a diverse range of activities that include homes, offices, hospitals, factories, laboratories, schools, public service, retail, hotels, restaurants, and convention space. Building type strongly influences energy use; for example, restaurants, hospitals, and laboratories have high energy demands compared to other commercial uses. Boston's building stock is characterized by thousands of turn-of-the-20th century homes and a postWorld War II building boom that expanded both residential buildings and commercial space. Boston is in the midst of another boom in building construction that is transforming neighborhoods across the city. The age of Boston's building stock is important because many of the city's residences were built before the 1950's and the establishment of the first building energy codes. These buildings typically have less insulation, are less air-tight, and use older, inefficient equipment, all of which result in higher energy use and GHG emissions compared to newer buildings. Recent buildings conform to a common energy code that aims to balance cost-effectiveness, building comfort, and environmental goals that leads to lower energy use and GHG emissions. Carbon-neutral buildings are highly efficient and do not use fossil fuels for heating and other services. New buildings will be built to the highest possible performance standards while avoiding the lock-in of fossil fuels. Existing buildings will require deep retrofits that reduce energy consumption and electrify heating systems. Achieving these goals requires a synergistic mix of fast-acting policies such as net zero codes, performance mandates, and retrofit requirements. These changes generate significant benefits but require significant upfront capital, a trained labor force, and the willingness and capacity of Boston's residents, businesses and institutions to invest in their buildings. These actions must also give socially vulnerable populations access to information, technical assistance, and financial resources. This will ensure that they can reap the benefits of lower utility bills, and not be further displaced as a result of higher housing costs, or left out of benefits that accrue to residents of new, efficient buildings},

Until now, we have lacked a comprehensive assessment of the environmental performance of UA relative to conventional agriculture, and results from earlier studies have been mixed. This is the first large-scale study to resolve this uncertainty across cities and types of UA, employing citizen science at 73 UA sites in Europe and the United States to compare UA products to food from conventional farms. Results reveal that the carbon footprint of food from UA is six times greater than conventional agriculture (420\,gCO2e versus 70\,gCO2e per serving). However, some UA crops (for example, tomatoes) and sites (for example, 25\% of individually managed gardens) outperform conventional agriculture. These exceptions suggest that UA practitioners can reduce their climate impacts by cultivating crops that are typically greenhouse-grown or air-freighted, maintaining UA sites for many years, and leveraging circularity (waste as inputs).},

The HRPDC has a strong interest in improving resiliency to flooding and sea level rise and in promoting cleaner air and water for its residents. Therefore, HRPDC submitted an application, workplan, and budget to the U.S. EPA for a CPRG planning grant under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). The planning grant was used to develop a Hampton Roads MSA-wide PCAP and will be used to develop a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP) and a subsequent Status Report. The PCAP: The PCAP identifies immediately impactful, cost-effective actions and projects that target priority greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions source sectors and can be implemented to reduce GHG and co-pollutant emissions in the near-term. This plan includes a simplified GHG inventory developed using downscaled state-level data and publicly available datasets such as in the EPA MOVES tool. Descriptions and analysis of priority GHG reduction measures included in the plan were identified through stakeholder input. Under the conditions of the CPRG planning grant, the PCAP has been developed and submitted to the EPA by the deadline of March 1, 2024. The following seven priority GHG reduction measures were identified as part of this PCAP: {$\bullet$} Measure 1: Create programs to support and incentivize a transition to clean energy, including onsite renewable energy, energy storage system deployment, and fuel switching. {$\bullet$} Measure 2: Reduce energy consumption and increase building decarbonization through programs to support, incentivize, and install energy efficiency and electrification measures. {$\bullet$} Measure 3: Develop an electric vehicle (EV) procurement plan and electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE) deployment strategy to support the adoption of EVs. {$\bullet$} Measure 4: Reduce vehicle miles traveled and support alternative modes of transportation through bike/pedestrian infrastructure investments. {$\bullet$} Measure 5: Reduce emissions from port operations through the adoption of low-carbon fuels, electric equipment, and operational changes. {$\bullet$} Measure 6: Reduce GHG emissions through improved equipment efficiencies, increased methane capture at waste and wastewater facilities, and organic waste diversion. {$\bullet$} Measure 7: Increase opportunities for carbon sequestration through tree planting, protecting, and restoring high-carbon coastal habitats, wetlands, and forest lands. The CCAP: The CCAP is a longer-term plan that identifies strategies to reduce GHG and co-pollutant emissions that aligns with statutory goals and requirements for reducing these emissions in an efficient and environmentally responsible manner. This plan will cover all source sectors in an MSA-wide GHG inventory and will provide substantial outreach and input opportunities, with a specific intention to engage with traditionally disadvantaged communities. The CCAP will be developed and submitted to the EPA no later than two years after the award of the planning grant (summer-fall 2025). The Status Report: The Status Report is a document that will be developed by HRPDC to report on CCAP progress. The Status Report will be delivered in 2027 and will include:},

Phase I: Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) -- March 1, 2024 The first phase of our journey begins with the creation of the PCAP. Our focus in this phase is to identify immediate, actionable strategies to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. The PCAP will encapsulate near-term priorities, reflecting our unique environmental challenges. This plan will serve as a springboard, enabling us to pursue the necessary funding through the EPA CPRG Implementation Phase and support for our envisioned projects. Phase II: Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP) With the foundational work of the PCAP in place, we will expand our vision in the CCAP, due Summer 2025. This comprehensive plan will delve deeper, covering significant GHG emission sources and carbon sinks within our region. It will outline both short- and long-term goals, strategies, and measures, encompassing a broad spectrum of environmental, economic, and project opportunity considerations.

  abstract = {Through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, the Climate Pollution Reduction Grants (CPRG) program is a two-phase federal grant that allows states, local governments, tribes, and territories to develop and implement community driven projects to reduce ambient air pollution while supporting the creation of quality jobs and lowering energy costs for Kansans, as well as to accelerate work to empower community-driven solutions in their neighborhoods. The Kansas Department of Health and Environment was designated to be the lead agency for the purposes of planning and outreach for this grant program in the state of Kansas. The Emissions Reduction and Mitigation Plan (E-RAMP) is the result of the planning award for the state from the CPRG. Through E-RAMP, this document includes all the required items from the CPRG guidelines to suffice as the Priority (Climate) Action Plan that will be submitted to EPA by the imposed March 1, 2024, deadline. This submission can be leveraged by eligible entities to apply for a share of \$4.3 billion in funding that will be awarded as part of the CPRG implementation grants to assist in funding community driven projects across the state that reduce greenhouse gases and their impacts. To meet requirements for the CPRG planning grant, this Priority Action Plan includes: {$\bullet$} Greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory: simplified list of emission sources and sinks, along with associated emissions quantified using standard methods. {$\bullet$} Greenhouse gas measures: specific projects to reduce emissions across the state. {$\bullet$} Low income and disadvantaged communities (LIDAC) benefit analysis and measures: with the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool, the Environmental Justice Screening and Mapping Tool, and work by the Heartland Environmental Justice Center to identify which communities across Kansas are burdened with low incomes, limited access to resources, and disproportionate exposure to environmental or climate impacts. {$\bullet$} Review of authority to implement. This Priority Action Plan (PAP) has been put together by the Kansas Department of Health and Environment to ensure that all areas of the state are included, and the projects are in the best interest of the people and environment of the state of Kansas. While some regional planning organizations or municipalities within the state may have their own sustainability or mitigation plans related to greenhouse gases and environmental impacts, the state Priority Action Plan encompasses the entire state and can be leveraged as a guide for all areas, especially entities who do not have resources of their own. Weather events such as drought, flooding, and temperature extremes have already had an impact on lives of the residents of Kansas. This action plan is intended to allow communities and organizations to set measurable goals to become more sustainable and conscious of greenhouse gas emissions while simultaneously providing an opportunity for federal funding to support the development of projects that assist in reaching those goals. This action plan is flexible and tailored to Kansas' unique resources, capacity, and includes a mix of key sectors responsible for emitting and absorbing greenhouse gases. KDHE ERAMP Priority Action Plan February 2024 4 Approach The establishment of E-RAMP necessitated the creation of a new BOA section to undertake and oversee CPRG planning efforts on behalf of the state of Kansas. Creation of the Data and Sustainability Section increased KDHE's capacity to complete required tasks to submit the action plan and allow Kansas communities the opportunity to pursue CPRG implementation funds directly from EPA. The process required an extensive public outreach effort to inform Kansas communities about E-RAMP objectives and assure public participation. An E-RAMP contact and information webpage (https://www.kdhe.ks.gov/2071/) was created to begin the outreach effort. KDHE partnered with Wichita State University (WSU) Environmental Finance Center and Heartland Environmental Justice Center to develop, schedule, and promote a series of in-person and virtual public meetings. A description of the engagement process and results are provided in this document. Meetings with state agencies, businesses, industry, stakeholder groups, and the public discussed the E-RAMP program and potential projects to include in the action plan. As a result of these engagements, approximately 50 projects were submitted to KDHE for consideration and inclusion in the Priority Action Plan. KDHE worked with the Wichita State University (WSU) Environmental Finance Center and Heartland Environmental Justice Center to develop the LIDAC analysis and further develop project proposals. KDHE intended to support all efforts across the state which met program goals to reduce ambient air pollution while supporting the creation of quality jobs and lowering energy costs for Kansans, as well as to accelerate work to empower community-driven solutions in their neighborhoods. The intention of the Priority Action Plan is to be all encompassing and provide necessary ambiguity that allows for state, regional, and local adaptations regarding projects that can help reduce greenhouse gases, improve carbon sinks, and provide additional benefits for Kansans. The inclusion and/or reference to specific projects does not favor specific projects over others that may not be referenced. A draft of the Priority Action Plan was provided for public comment prior to the submittal to EPA to ensure that all voices within Kansas have an opportunity to provide input on the creation of the statewide plan. The public comments received are not included for a specific response within the final document but received comments provided impetus for changes from the initial draft developed. After the public comment period the final version of the Priority Action Plan was completed, posted on the E-RAMP webpage, and provided to EPA prior to the March 1, 2024, grant imposed deadline},

  abstract = {The current state of Deep Energy Retrofit (DER) performance in the U.S. has been assessed in 116 homes in the United States (US), using actual and simulated data gathered from the available domestic literature. Substantial airtightness reductions averaging 63\% (n=48) were reported (two- to three-times more than in conventional retrofits), with average post-retrofit airtightness of 4.7 Air Changes per House at 50 Pascal (ACH50) (n=94). Yet, mechanical ventilation was not installed consistently. In order to avoid indoor air quality (IAQ) issues, all future DERs should comply with ASHRAE 62.2-2013 requirements or equivalent. Projects generally achieved good energy results, with average annual net-site and net-source energy savings of 47\%{\textpm}20\% and 45\%{\textpm}24\% (n=57 and n=35), respectively, and carbon emission reductions of 47\%{\textpm}22\% (n=23). Net-energy reductions did not vary reliably with house age, airtightness, or reported project costs, but pre-retrofit energy usage was correlated with total reductions (MMBtu). Annual energy costs were reduced \$1,283{\textpm}\$804 (n=31), from a pre-retrofit average of \$2,738{\textpm}\$1,065 to \$1,588{\textpm}\$561 post-retrofit (n=25 and n=39). The average reported incremental project cost was \$40,420{\textpm}\$30,358 (n=59). When financed on a 30-year term, the median change in net-homeownership cost was only \$1.00 per month, ranging from \$149 in savings to an increase of \$212 (mean=\$15.67{\textpm}\$87.74; n=28), and almost half of the projects resulted in reductions in net-cost. The economic value of a DER may be much greater than is suggested by these net-costs, because DERs entail substantial non-energy benefits (NEBs), and retrofit measures may add value to a home at resale similarly to general remodeling, PV panel installation, and green/energy efficient home labels. These results provide estimates of the potential of DERs to address energy use in existing homes across climate zones that can be used in future estimates of the technical potential to reduce household energy use and greenhouse gas emissions through DERs.},

In urban regions, amendments are used to support local food production, maintain vegetation for landscaping and recreational use, and reclaim disturbed soils. Urban regions generate large quantities of wasted organic resources for potential application aiding in creating a circular nutrient economy. There is a growing interest in understanding the effects of amendments such as compost, biosolids, and biochar on soil properties in agricultural settings. Gaps remain, however, in assessing their effects in urban land uses. We conducted a literature review to assess the effects of compost, biochar, and biosolids on soil carbon and soil quality of urban soils managed for gardening, landscaping, recreation, and reclamation. Application of organic matter amendments led to an average increase of 3.6 units of soil organic matter\% (SOM\%). Compost and biochar improved SOM\% the most, by 3.1 and 6.5 units of SOM\%, respectively. Biosolids resulted in the smallest increase in SOM\% but had greater nutrient benefits than other amendments. Parameters related to chemical and physical soil quality improved with the application of amendments. Gaps in the literature remain, such as assessing urban gardens, soil to depths greater than 30~cm, and the persistence of SOM in amended soils. This meta-analysis proposes that organic matter amendments are a powerful means to improve soil quality in urban regions, provide vital cobenefits to surrounding communities, and increase soil carbon storage.},

  abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines offsets as a specific activity or set of activities intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase the storage of carbon, or enhance GHG removals from the atmosphere [1]. From a city perspective, they provide a mechanism to negate residual GHG emissions--- those the city is unable to reduce directly---by supporting projects that avoid or sequester them outside of the city's reporting boundary. Offsetting GHG emissions is a controversial topic for cities, as the co-benefits of the investment are typically not realized locally. For this reason, offsetting emissions is considered a last resort, a strategy option available when the city has exhausted all others. However, offsets are likely to be a necessity to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and promote emissions reductions in the near term. While public and private sector partners pursue the more complex systems transformation, cities can utilize offsets to support short-term and relatively cost-effective reductions in emissions. Offsets can be a relatively simple, certain, and high-impact way to support the transition to a low-carbon world. This report focuses on carbon offset certificates, more often referred to as offsets. Each offset represents a metric ton of verified carbon dioxide (CO2) or equivalent emissions that is reduced, avoided, or permanently removed from the atmosphere (``sequestered'') through an action taken by the creator of the offset. The certificates can be traded and retiring (that is, not re-selling) offsets can be a useful component of an overall voluntary emissions reduction strategy, alongside activities to lower an organization's direct and indirect emissions. In the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), the GHG accounting system used by the City of Boston, any carbon offset certificates that the City has can be deducted from the City's total GHG emissions.},

  abstract = {The National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the United States Department of Energy (DOE) Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy Strategic Programs sought to address gaps in sub-national energy data. This report describes the methodologies developed to estimate the electricity and natural gas consumption and expenditures for the residential, commercial, and industrial sectors at sub-state geographies and made available on the State and Local Energy Data2 site to enable more strategic energy decisions by a variety of stakeholders. To estimate energy consumption at the sub-state level, researchers proportionally allocated energy sales and revenue values reported by the Energy Information Administration from state and utility geographies down to smaller geographies. Within each sector, population distributions are developed through the selection of cohorts assumed to have homogeneous energy use characteristics. In the residential sector, cohorts are based on locational, occupancy, physical, and demographic characteristics of the housing units. In the commercial sector, cohorts are based on climate zone, location, and use types of commercial square footage. The industrial sector is unique in that large greenhouse gas emitters are required to report at the facility level. These are treated individually, but the remaining cohorts are based on the North American Industrial Classification System (NAICS) codes and employment size class for business establishments. Energy values by cohort come from available statistical samples. These are then rescaled to match aggregate values from electric and natural gas utility reported sales and volumes as well as business reported fuel expenditures. These methodologies model only electricity and natural gas consumption and expenditures and do not address other forms of building energy consumption and expenditures such as bottled gas (generally propane) or heating oil or on-site industrial consumption of coal, coke, or diesel fuel for process energy. Residential sector modeling generally yields more accurate results due to greater data availability and uniformity of per customer energy use. The opposite is true of the industrial sector where significant disparities in energy consumption by industry and among facilities within industries cause modeling challenges. In small towns where a single industrial facility can comprise most of the sector's consumption, modeled industrial sector data may be unreliable for planning purposes. Overall, a comparison with reported values by sector demonstrates that these sectorspecific modeling methodologies provide reasonable results which can inform subnational-level energy decision making where measured, utility-reported data is unavailable. In addition, the modeled data provides robust, standardized, and disaggregated national data.},

The Missouri Department of Natural Resources (department) received a grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to develop plans required for Missouri to compete for this federal grant funding. The department coordinated with Missouri citizens, other state agencies, local governments, nonprofits, utilities, industries, and numerous other stakeholders across the State to develop the Missouri Plan for Environmental Improvement Grants (plan). This plan qualifies Missouri for federal funding to support investment in Missouri communities to reduce air pollution, create high-quality jobs, spur economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for all Missourians. This plan satisfies the EPA grant requirement for the department to develop a Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP). This project is funded wholly or in part by the EPA under assistance agreement 96702701 to the department. The contents of this plan do not necessarily reflect the views and policies of the EPA, nor does the EPA endorse trade names or recommend the use of commercial products mentioned in this plan. The purpose of this plan is to ensure that all Missouri communities and municipalities, regardless of size, have an opportunity to implement projects identified herein through the implementation phase of the federal grant program with \$4.3 billion available nationwide that Missouri can compete for. Throughout the development of this plan, the department engaged with stakeholders to collect greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reduction project ideas for inclusion in this plan. This plan describes the results of this engagement and project descriptions that are of interest to these stakeholder entities. For the purposes of this plan, emissions reduction measures and project categories should be considered broadly applicable to any area of the state. Additionally, agencies in both the Kansas City and St. Louis areas, the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) and the East-West Gateway Council of Governments (EWGW), respectively, received their own Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) Planning grants. These organizations have also been key collaborators in the development of this plan. For this reason, and to further ensure there is no confusion about whether a community at the edges of these areas is covered by this plan, the Missouri portion of both metropolitan statistical areas are also considered covered by this plan, and emissions reduction measures included herein should be considered applicable to these areas as well. The PCAPs developed by MARC and by EWGW, and the emission reduction measures included in those PCAPs are also hereby incorporated by reference into this plan upon their release. This plan is organized into the following sections: 1. GHG Emissions Inventory 2. Priority Emission Reduction Measures 3. Low-Income/Disadvantaged Community (LIDAC) Benefits Analysis 4. Review of Authority 5. Intersection with Other Funding Availability 6. Coordination and Outreach},

To create strategies to address extreme heat, researchers seek to identify the factors that exacerbate extreme heat. This research has shown that higher temperatures are amplified in areas with higher concentrations of pavement and impervious surface, as these areas tend to absorb residual heat and hold that heat longer than vegetation would. Using remote sensing and satellite imagery, the Council has mapped land surface temperature on two dates. First, temperatures mapped in 2022 show recent, high-resolution data. The 2022 data is intended to show the heat differences across the region, not the maximum temperature that any specific area can reach. Temperatures from an extreme, three-day heat wave occurring in 2016 are also mapped, but at coarser resolution. The 2016 data more closely approximates the maximum land surface temperature that urban areas may reach. In both cases, maps show that developed areas are hotter in temperature, while parks and other greenspace, and areas near water bodies, are cooler. It is important to emphasize that the data consists of land surface temperature, as opposed to air temperature. Air temperature data can provide a better measure of potential extreme heat impacts on human health. The use of land surface temperature has ensured that this analysis has full metropolitan coverage. In addition, the use of land surface temperature can be helpful in identifying land use and built environment strategies to mitigate extreme heat in specific locations through a variety of site-specific interventions.},

To date, these two processes have not been studied together and compared with transboundary fossil fuel-based CO2 emissions of urban energy use. We leverage remote sensing and machine learning to quantify biogenic CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2012, across 11 U.S cities, including central and suburban cities, in different climate zones. Results indicate that in situ carbon sequestration by greenery varied moderately across cities (-2.1 to -0.87 Mg CO2 ha--1 yr--1), while emissions from the carbon stock change due to land conversion varied much more (-3.4 to 9.8 Mg CO2 ha--1 yr--1), indicating that the latter dominates biogenic CO2 emissions. Net biogenic CO2 emissions were negative (carbon sink) in four cities, while large net positive emissions were present in rapidly growing suburbs. As a ratio of community-wide energy use for travel and buildings, biogenic CO2 emissions were a small proportion in the core cities Denver (0.17\%) and Minneapolis (0.33\%) and as high as 38.2\% in growing exurban communities. These results show that land cover change and greenery will be important policy levers in zero-carbon city planning.}

Traffic counts are scheduled before a project starts or after it is completed, but some construction effects are unavoidable when collecting traffic data. Construction affects traffic patterns on the entire road network, another reason why users should reference historical traffic volumes. Roadways Counted for AADT: Trunk Highways are major roadways: Interstate US Highway MN State Highway Local system roads are lesser roadways: County State Aid Highway County Road Municipal State Aid Street Other additional roadways as needed for federal reporting, such as: Municipal Non-State Aid Street Township Road Airport Road Vehicles traveling along a divided highway Vehicles traveling along a divided highway Traffic volume information has many uses: Creating annual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for state government use Annual reporting of VMT and AADT to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for federal travel analysis and funding One of many factors in annual funding of the County and Municipal State Aid road systems Component of rail crossing safety reviews, speeds and crash rate analysis Facilitating decision making for planners, engineers, forecasters, businesses, and the general public The traffic volume program is funded in two parts. Data collection activities are funded by the MnDOT district or responsible agency.  Processing, review and publication are financed by federal funds. If time and/or resources in any given count season become limited the priorities of the program will be Trunk Highway and HPMS counts, followed by CSAH and MSAS, and finally County Roads. The traffic volume program produces AADT values for approximately 39,000 count locations and traffic segments. A traffic segment is a section of roadway where a single AADT value or traffic volume is applied. The traffic volumes along segments may vary within a range determined by a 1990 customer/user survey. Based on this survey, the traffic volume program developed the Acceptable Percent Change table: 4,100 on Trunk Highways 13,500 on County State Aid Highways 6,100 on County Roads 9,600 on Municipal State Aid Streets 3,700 on Ramps 2,000 on other roadways as needed for HPMS There are several ways to collect data for determining AADT: Workers installing continuous count sensors on a highway Workers installing continuous count sensors on a roadway At least 34,000 are short duration counts (typically 48 hours). These sites only collect traffic volume and make up the majority of all count locations. At least 2,000 are sites where data comes from the Regional Traffic Management Center.  These sites collect volume data from sensors or loop detectors which is extracted by MnDOT central office and converted to an AADT. At least 1,500 are Vehicle Classification sites. These collect traffic volume and vehicle type.  At least 180 are an Automatic Traffic Recorder, ATR.  These are continuous devices with loops in the pavement that collect traffic volume.  Some sites also collect vehicle classification and/or speed data. At least 20 are a Weigh in Motion System, WIM.  These are continuous sites that collect vehicle weight, type, speed and volume. How and Where Counts are Taken Most traffic data is collected by MnDOT District staff.  Some counties and cities, especially in the Metro, submit their own count data. MnDOT provides a yearly schedule of locations to count. Upon request, MnDOT will provide PDF maps or GIS files of the count locations.  Approximately half of the trunk highway locations and a quarter of the local system locations are scheduled each year.  Refer to the Traffic Counting Schedule reference for details. Most traffic counting occurs between April and October.  More details about field activities are available in our Program Guidelines for Site Scheduling, Count Collection, and Count Submission. MnDOT was recently given FWHA approval to use mobile sourced AADTs where they meet validation metrics.  To learn more please contact Traffic Forecasting and Analysis at MnDOT and/or review the overall workflow for how mobile sourced AADTs will be used: MnDOT Mobile Source AADT Workflow Summary. Raw counts may be submitted to MnDOT at any time, but may not be used if submitted past the annual reporting deadline.  Please contact the Traffic Volume Section for how to submit data. AADT values are determined in the fall/winter and sent to the local county/city engineer for comment. The Official AADT values, or Traffic Volumes, are then posted to the web the following spring/summer (Data Products). Materials used by partners who collect and submit short-term traffic data at established collection sites in Minnesota can be found in the shared MnDOT Traffic Data Collection Materials.}

This plan is a deliverable of the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) program and builds on the state's climate change planning work, including and the state's greenhouse gas emissions inventory. 7 This PCAP applies to the area within the boundaries of the state of Minnesota and focuses on climate change mitigation actions in four Climate Action Framework goal areas: Clean Transportation, ClimateSmart Natural and Working Lands, Clean Energy and Efficient Buildings, and Clean Economy. Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program overview The EPA Climate Pollution Reduction Grant program8 provides \$5 billion in grants to states, local governments, Tribes, and territories to develop and implement ambitious plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and other harmful air pollution. Authorized under Section 60114 of the Inflation Reduction Act, this two-phase program provides \$250 million for noncompetitive planning grants and \$4.6 billion for competitive implementation grants. The CPRG program is part of the Biden Administration's Justice40 initiative, which sets a goal that 40 percent of the benefits of certain federal investments flow to disadvantaged communities that are marginalized, underserved, and overburdened by pollution. Planning grants MPCA accepted a planning grant on behalf of the state of Minnesota in June 2023. In addition to the state, the EPA awarded planning grants to the following entities within the geography of Minnesota: {$\bullet$} Shakopee Mdewakanton Sioux Community {$\bullet$} Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe {$\bullet$} Midwest Tribal Energy Resources Association (MTERA) (covering a consortium of Tribal Nations in the region) {$\bullet$} Metropolitan Council (for the Minneapolis-St. Paul-Bloomington metropolitan statistical area) EPA maintains a list of the lead organizations for planning grants. 9 The planning grant includes three deliverables: the Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP), a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), and a Status Report. For the state's planning grant, the deliverable deadlines are: {$\bullet$} PCAP: March 1, 2024 {$\bullet$} CCAP: June 28, 2025 {$\bullet$} Status Report: June 28, 2027},

The Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) is the first of two plans for the Miami Valley, identifying projects that could be funded in a second funding round from CPRG. It will be followed by the Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), which is a more systematic analysis and engagement process. The PCAP involved the development of a GHG emissions inventory for the three counties in the Miami Valley - Greene, Miami and Montgomery - as well as contextual analysis of trends and drivers of energy and emissions. Miami Valley, like numerous other US regions, faces the dual challenges of electrifying heating and transportation while concurrently transitioning the electricity grid to cleaner sources, both of which will require major investments. Cleaning the electricity system will cut total GHG emissions in half; the technologies required to enable this transition are already cost-effective. Decarbonizing transportation and heating involves technologies that have an incremental upfront cost, but are lower cost to operate. These technologies are also readily available. The residential sector is the largest source of GHG emissions; supporting measures in this sector will not only generate new employment opportunities, but also improve the quality of housing and affordability of housing across the region. The energy transition will be aided by opportunities for efficiency including measures such as building retrofits, increasing the walking, cycling and transit mode shares, as well as by the electrification equipment itself - electric vehicles and heat pumps are more efficient than the incumbent technologies. Maximizing efficiencies minimizes the need for additional electrical capacity, reducing the overall energy transition costs. There is an added benefit in that increased efficiency also reduces the operating costs for households and businesses, and provides a revenue stream to finance the investments required. With these insights in mind, an engagement process identified possible priority projects through a survey to more than 30 people, ten interviews with representatives of interested parties, engagement with relevant agencies, outreach to Low Income and Disadvantaged Communities (LIDAC) and engagement with committees of MVRPC. Nine possible projects were identified (see the following pages with the summary diagram of the projects identified and Table E.1, in which each of them is described).},

However, there is little understanding of the quantity and distribution of carbon stored in our remaining wetlands or of the potential effects of human disturbance on these stocks. Here we use field data from the 2011 National Wetland Condition Assessment to provide unbiased estimates of soil carbon stocks for wetlands at regional and national scales. We find that wetlands in the conterminous United States store a total of 11.52\,PgC, much of which is within soils deeper than 30\,cm. Freshwater inland wetlands, in part due to their substantial areal extent, hold nearly ten-fold more carbon than tidal saltwater sites---indicating their importance in regional carbon storage. Our data suggest a possible relationship between carbon stocks and anthropogenic disturbance. These data highlight the need to protect wetlands to mitigate the risk of avoidable contributions to climate change.},

  abstract = {The region that birthed the modern-day environmental movement has another opportunity to serve as vanguard against a growing, global challenge. When the Cuyahoga River caught fire again in downtown Cleveland in 1969, the event fanned a smoldering movement into a roaring protest against the devastating impact of human pollution on the nation's waterways, air quality and natural ecosystems. The result was the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA) and an unprecedented wave of federal regulation to counter polluters and protect our fragile environment. More than 50 years later, another daunting challenge to our global sustainability in the form of climate change has prompted the US EPA to take dramatic steps to spur regions, states, tribes, and territories across the nation to counter the climate challenge. This Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) represents the first key outcome in a major climate planning initiative for the entire Cleveland-Elyria Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA). It builds on previous and ongoing climate action plans at the municipal and county level. The regional greenhouse gas inventory highlights the significant contribution of electricity generation and transportation sources to climate change. Given the high contribution from these sources, the projected emissions reductions from the electricity, building efficiency, steel manufacturing and transportation priority measures exhibit relatively high impact toward emissions reduction. These are the greatest areas of opportunity to mitigate climate change in Northeast Ohio, while expansion of forests and restoration of tree canopy offer opportunity for carbon sequestration. The Cleveland-Elyria MSA is an extremely diverse region and spans the full spectrum of legacy industrial, inner-ring suburban, contemporary exurban, and rural communities (including small villages and historical Western Reserve towns). The priority measures in this PCAP evolved from direct, multi-modal engagement with decision-making, technical and public stakeholders. The measures comprise a menu of potential actions to reduce GHG emissions that provide communities with options to best fit their respective needs. The Cleveland-Elyria MSA has significant low-income and disadvantaged communities (LIDACs) in diverse locations. While many stakeholders recognize much of the City of Cleveland meets LIDAC criteria, many inner-ring Cleveland suburbs in Cuyahoga County are also LIDACs. Furthermore, there are LIDACs in legacy industrial towns with high minority populations well outside of Cleveland, such as Elyria, Lorain, and Painesville. There are also LIDACs in rural, eastern Geauga County, due to growing Amish concentrations. The diverse geography of LIDACs undergirds the need for regional climate action planning and spotlights a tremendous opportunity to build consensus to combat a shared challenge. NOACA had already undertaken a regional greenhouse gas emissions inventory prior to the US EPA's initial CPRG Program announcement. NOACA and City of Cleveland staff worked with ICLEI USA to ensure that the regional inventory reflected the recommended sectors from USA EPA and feedback received from stakeholders during NOACA's extensive engagement effort. The diagram on the next page illustrates the relationship between these sectors, symbolized by key icons. A subsequent page outlines the priority measures developed for this PCAP, potential actions within those measures, and the icons that represent the emissions sectors most affected by each priority measure.},

This two phase program provided noncompetitive planning grants to applicants in summer 2023 to fund the creation of the Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP). The purpose of the PCAP is to understand current and future GHG emissions, design policies and programs to reduce these emissions, and begin collaboration with other entities and communities which will benefit and be affected by implementation. The PCAP also provides support to the Phase 2 Competitive Implementation Grants. Any project proposed within a metro region, state, or tribal area for inclusion in a Phase 2 Grant application must be supported by one or more Implementation Measures included in that area's PCAP. The planning grant to develop the Priority Climate Action Plan for Cincinnati's Metropolitan Statistical Area was awarded to OKI Regional Council of Governments as the lead developer. OKI collaborated with Green Umbrella and other agencies in the Plan Working Group to develop the PCAP. The group invited community members across the region to form the Plan Steering Committee, consisting of representatives from a plethora of local governments, non-profit organizations and industr},

  abstract = {Climate change is the defining global challenge of the twenty-first century. And as the recent increase in climate-induced wildfires and extreme weather events has demonstrated, it is likely to have significant impacts on the Portland-Vancouver-Hillsboro, OR-WA, Metropolitan Statistical Area MSA (MSA). The MSA includes seven counties (Clark and Skamania Counties in Washington and Clackamas, Columbia, Multnomah, Washington, and Yamhill Counties in Oregon). The CPRG program, and particularly this PCAP, are focused on ``expeditious implementation of investment-ready policies, programs, and projects.'' This PCAP reflects this focus on implementation-ready climate measures. Cities, counties, and regional agencies across the MSA have conducted exhaustive climate planning, and Metro drew on 15 adopted or in-progress plans in creating this PCAP. This abundance of existing plans means that there is no shortage of ideas about how public agencies in the MSA can use their existing authority to dramatically reduce GHG emissions. Metro developed this PCAP based on a strong foundation of established climate action planning and implementation in the MSA. Over the past two decades, agencies in the MSA have collaborated across all levels of government to reduce GHG emissions. As part of this PCAP, Metro conducted an MSA-wide community GHG inventory. The priority measures primarily address the sectors with the highest contributions to community-level emissions and that are within the unique role that local and regional agencies in the MSA play in reducing GHG emissions. This PCAP contains nine priority strategies to reduce GHG emissions, shown in Table 1, that support, rather than duplicate, state-level programs and policies. Table 1: Priority Climate Action Plan strategies Transportation Trans-1: Implement high-capacity transit across the metropolitan area Trans-2: Redesign streets and infrastructure to reduce delays for transit vehicles Trans-3: Expand transit signal priority Trans-4: Expand bicycle and pedestrian network Trans-5: Expand use of parking pricing Trans-6: Expand the use of clean fuels in the region's transit fleets Commercial and Residential Buildings Res-1: Expand existing residential energy efficiency retrofit programs, with a focus on low-income households Res-2: Fund additional energy efficiency measures in publicly funded, newly constructed affordable housing units Materials and Waste Management Waste-1: Expand the availability of residential composting programs Implementing the measures included in this PCAP is anticipated to result in a broad range of cobenefits, including air quality improvements, improved public health outcomes, economic benefits, and increased climate resilience. Through review of community-based equity- and  Priority Climate Action Plan for the Portland-Vancouver MSA (EPA Grant \# 02J36101) ES-2 environmental justice-focused plans and engagement with community partners, Metro also designed the priority measures to intentionally benefit low income and disadvantaged communities (LIDACs). Local agencies with the capacity and existing level of planning required are preparing CPRG implementation grant applications related to the measures identified in this PCAP. More planning funds in the region could help support more local agencies to complete the comprehensive planning necessary to participate more fully in future implementation grants.},

Investing in solutions that feed people instead of landfills became more than just a nice idea --- it became a priority. The U.S. federal government released its first comprehensive food waste strategy, drawing on the collective powers of three major agencies. Businesses embraced pre-competitive collaboration to reduce food waste and drive profitability. The climate community, which has historically overlooked the agriculture sector, celebrated food waste reduction for its potential to curb methane emissions. Major media outlets ran headlines that introduced the topic to millions of new readers. And the world's leading philanthropists rallied around an ambitious new roadmap to address the root cause of waste in our food system. ReFED's fingerprints are on each of these advancements --- as an advisor, a researcher, a translator, a convener, and a catalyst --- and it shows how far we've come since we issued the first Roadmap to Reduce U.S. Food Waste in 2016. We've added tools to our toolkit, grown our sphere of influence, and cemented our place as the primary source of information for food loss and waste. As noted by our partners, ReFED has become the ``accelerator in chief'' of the food waste movement. This year's Annual Impact Report theme --- Acceleration --- is a tribute to that evolution and the rapid progress that's been made. In the pages ahead, you'll find collections of stories and moments that underscore that feeling of acceleration --- moments that we will be able to point to ten years from now as having altered the trajectory of food waste in this country and beyond. This report is also a thank you letter. Systems change is by nature a collective effort. Our acceleration --- and the entire food waste movement's acceleration --- is the product of profound generosity. This year, we welcomed new partners that went all in on ReFED. Their fingerprints are on every page, every story, every word in this report. Thank you for believing in our work and accelerating us toward a world that makes the very best use of the food we grow.

  abstract = {Commercial building retrofits present a prime opportunity to improve building energy efficiency. This is increasingly happening, but usually through simple upgrades of individual building components such as equipment or lamp replacements. These equipment- or component-level retrofits, however, have been shown to have less potential for whole building energy savings as compared to comprehensive systembased approaches (Regnier et al. 2018a). A system-based approach goes beyond a single component, such as by incorporating additional elements or controls within an end use system, or leverages interactions with other building components or end use systems to achieve deeper levels of energy savings. Systems retrofits hold the potential for much greater savings and are critical to achieving aggressive energy reduction goals in the existing commercial building stock. This study sought to answer three questions: 1. To what extent are systems retrofits taking place in the building marketplace today? 2. Are systems retrofits more prevalent in high energy saving projects? 3. What kinds of efficiency measures are most prevalent in system retrofits? This study also solicited input from industry stakeholders on the state of system retrofits currently, as well as perceived barriers to further uptake. The results of the study revealed several findings: Key Finding \#1 Systems retrofits are relatively uncommon, representing less than 20 percent of total projects Key Finding \#2: Systems retrofits show a greater occurrence in high energy saving projects Key finding \#3. Lighting measures are the most prevalent in all types of retrofits, while there is a higher prevalence of HVAC measures in systems retrofits than in non-system retrofits. Key finding \#4. Several barriers prevent wider deployment of systems, including a lack of awareness of system retrofit opportunities, perceived higher costs, ease of system design, installation and operation, and in some cases policy barriers. The study addressed these questions by examining commercial building retrofit data from an array of sources, including utility customer incentive programs, federal government facility retrofit programs and energy service company (ESCO) retrofit data. These were supplemented by retrofit project data from several case study repositories, including the U.S. Department of Energy's High Performance Building Database, the New Building Institute's Getting to Zero Database, and the U.S. General Service Administration's Deep Retrofit program. The final cleansed dataset included over 12,000 retrofit projects, including over 4,500 projects that included energy savings data. A wide range of commercial building types were represented, with office and retail most prevalent.}

The CPRG planning grant enables states, MSAs, and tribal governments to develop a Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP), followed by a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan and Status Report, over a four-year period. EPA requires that all PCAPs include a Greenhouse Gas Inventory, quantifed GHG reduction measures, a Low Income/ Disadvantaged Communities (LIDAC) Benefts Analysis, as well as a review of authority to implement each measure. The Louisiana Priority Climate Action Plan presents a focused list of cross-sector measures to reduce GHG emissions and harmful air pollution and maximize the benefts of climate action in overburdened communities. Section One Sets the Stage and highlights background information, including a summary of the 2022 Louisiana Climate Action Plan which the Louisiana Priority Climate Action Plan builds on. Section Two focuses on the Process of development of the priority measures and elaborates on the outreach and engagement conducted to solicit input and feedback for the development of the focus areas and priority actions. Section Three contains the Priority Measures and provides information and details on the 13 focus areas, 29 priority outputs, and 89 priority actions, including quantifed GHG emission reductions and a review of authority to implement. Within each of the focus areas, a status update and transformative impact of the respective measures are provided. An intersection with federal funding overview where Louisiana has pursued and/or received funding through the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) and Infation Reduction Act (IRA) is also provided.

Planners base their recommendations on a substantial body of research that examines the impact of compact development on driving. Different studies, however, have found different outcomes: Some studies find that compact development causes people to drive less, while other studies do not. I use meta-regression analysis to a) explain why different studies on driving and compact development yield different results, and b) combine different findings from many studies into reliable statistics that can better inform planning practice. I address the following questions: Does compact development make people drive less, and if so, how much less? I find that compact development does make people drive less, because most of the compact development features I study have a statistically significant negative influence on driving. The impact, however, is fairly small: Compact development features do not appear to have much influence on driving. My findings are limited to some extent because they are derived from small sample sizes. Takeaway for practice: Planners should not rely on compact development as their only strategy for reducing driving unless their goals for reduced driving are very modest and can be achieved at a low cost.},

The plan encompasses the four-county Milwaukee Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA), comprised of Milwaukee, Ozaukee, Washington, and Waukesha Counties. Future deliverables include a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan by June 2025, and a Status Report due by May 2027. The purpose of this action plan is to identify baseline greenhouse (GHG) emissions, identify priority strategies to reduce these emissions, quantify the emissions benefits of the priority strategies, analyze impacts to low-income and disadvantaged communities, and summarize stakeholder engagement. Approach to Developing the Priority Pollution Reduction Action Plan The foundational document for this action plan is the Milwaukee Climate and Equity Plan, adopted on June 23, 2023, which provides the vision for climate action in Milwaukee.1  The plan has two primary objectives: 1) establishing a joint City-County goal of a 45 percent reduction of county-wide GHG emissions by 2030 and carbon neutrality by 2050, and 2) improving racial and economic equity by creating green jobs that pay a minimum of \$40,000 per year and focusing recruitment on people of color. The plan is the direct outgrowth of over three years of public discussions and planning through the City-County Taskforce on Climate and Economic Equity. Community members played an important role in developing Milwaukee's Climate and Equity Plan and work continues to amplify the voices of residents. The Milwaukee Climate and Equity Plan outlines 10 Big Ideas for Action with strategies that can be achieved in collaboration among government agencies, business, community-based organizations, and numerous other partners. The opportunity provided through the Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) program continues to foster and expand these partnerships to pursue transformative change that results in significant GHG reductions, equitable development, and improved public health. This action plan encompasses the robust public engagement effort conducted as part of the Milwaukee Climate and Equity Plan. Contributing agencies to the Priority Pollution Reduction Action Plan include the four counties in the Milwaukee MSA and those communities that have signed a letter of support for the grant (see Map 1). {$\bullet$} City of Wauwatosa {$\bullet$} City of West Allis {$\bullet$} Village of Bayside {$\bullet$} Village of Shorewood {$\bullet$} Village of Whitefish Bay {$\bullet$} Milwaukee Metropolitan Sewerage District {$\bullet$} Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy {$\bullet$} Milwaukee County {$\bullet$} Ozaukee County {$\bullet$} Washington County {$\bullet$} Waukesha County {$\bullet$} City of Milwaukee {$\bullet$} City of Mequon {$\bullet$} City of Muskego {$\bullet$} City of Waukesha Multiple meetings were held with coordinating workgroup members to discuss the planning process, identify priority measures, and share draft materials. A survey was conducted in December 2023 to gather information on each communities' levels of interest in potential priority measures. A meeting was also held that provided an opportunity for all municipalities within the Milwaukee MSA to learn about the grant and become engaged in the planning process.1 In addition to the municipalities supporting the planning effort, state and regional partnerships contributed to the plan and assisted the team with identifying GHG inventory data, connections with statewide organizations, and priority strategies. Specifically, these partners included the University of Wisconsin -- Milwaukee, the Waukesha County Green Team, the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources, and the Wisconsin Local Government Climate Coalition.},

With funding from the IRA, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) coordinated the development and implementation of climate action plans to reduce GHGs for states, U.S. territories, municipalities, air pollution control agencies, tribes, and other regional organizations. CPRG is a dual-phase program: {$\bullet$} Phase One o Planning Phase: \$1 million was provided to the 67 most populous MSAs to develop climate action plans to reduce GHGs. o A 4-year grant period {$\bullet$} Phase Two o Implementation Phase: \$4.3 billion for grants to implement GHG reduction measures developed through the phase one planning grants. o A 5-year grant period Through Phase One, the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council (TBRPC) received the \$1 million planning grant funding from the EPA to lead the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater MSA developed of a climate action plan. By participating in Phase One, the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater Metropolitan Statistical Area (MSA) jurisdictions, municipal agencies, departments, other municipal government offices, council of governments, metropolitan planning commissions, or other regional organizations comprised of multiple municipalities are eligible to apply for grant funding through Phase Two. The Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater MSA Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP) analyzed high-priority, implementation ready projects in the largest GHG sectors in the MSA. The analysis showed that the energy and transportation and mobile combustion sectors as the largest emitters with 45.3\% from the energy sector and 43.2\% from the transportation sector. Jurisdictions and agency partners prioritized near-term, implementation ready projects in all sectors, but there was a large focus on the energy and transportation sectors. Projects that were identified were solar installation, deep energy efficiency retrofits, extend public, and converting on-road vehicles to electric vehicles. Using the identified projects in those sectors, a benefits and reduction measures analysis was completed. With a medium population growth in the MSA, implementing the prioritized projects in the energy and transportation sector is projected to decrease in GHG by 2.14\% by 2030 and 51\% by 2050. These projects could be focused on areas in the low-income and disadvantaged communities (LIDAC) that were identified, and engage with community stakeholders to establish community needs. Moving into the Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP), these areas will be expanded on to develop a robust plan that sets actionable goals and measures to help create a more resilient future.},

  abstract = {The Tennessee Volunteer Emission Reduction Strategy (TVERS) is a collaborative emissions reduction plan developed by the Tennessee Department of Environment and Conservation (TDEC) with partners statewide. The intent of this plan is to support investment in programs and strategies that reduce pollutant emissions, create high-quality jobs, spur economic growth, and enhance the quality of life for all Tennesseans. This plan is built so future generations can enjoy the economic prosperity and abundant natural resources, including our clean air, that we enjoy today. It highlights and honors our natural heritage while providing pathways to economic growth. TVERS is funded through the US Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Climate Pollution Reduction Grant (CPRG) program, which was established in the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 (IRA). The CPRG program is providing \$5 billion in grants to states, local governments, tribes, and territories to develop and implement plans for reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other harmful air pollutants. EPA has organized the program into two phases: Phase 1 provides \$250 million in noncompetitive planning grants and Phase 2 provides \$4.6 billion for competitive implementation grants (\$4.3 billion available to states and municipalities, and \$300 million available to tribes and territories) for eligible entities to implement measures identified in a plan. The first deliverable in the planning phase of the CPRG is a Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP). The PCAP is focused on a simplified GHG Inventory and near-term, high-priority, implementation-ready measures. The measures contained herein should be construed as broadly applicable to any entity in the state eligible for receiving funding under the CPRG implementation grants and other funding streams. This plan serves as the basis and requirement to position Tennessee for additional federal funding for programs that will benefit Tennessee communities and Tennesseans statewide. This plan includes the following required elements, established in the CPRG guidelines: {$\bullet$} GHG Emissions Inventory, {$\bullet$} Priority Measures and Reduction Estimates, {$\bullet$} Benefits Analysis, 10 {$\bullet$} Low-Income and Disadvantaged Communities (LIDAC) Benefits Analysis, {$\bullet$} Review of Authority to Implement, {$\bullet$} Intersection with Other Funding Availability, and {$\bullet$} Coordination and Engagement. TDEC contracted with Civil \& Environmental Consultants, Inc. (CEC) and Ernst \& Young (EY) to complete the required technical sections of the PCAP, specifically the GHG Emissions Inventory (TN PCAP Inventory or Inventory), priority measures and reduction estimates, and benefits analyses. TDEC, CEC, and EY represent the Project Team for the PCAP. In selecting priority measures for inclusion in the PCAP, TDEC focused on voluntary or incentive-based activities that resulted in significant GHG emissions reductions. The development of the PCAP involved extensive coordination with Tennessee (TN) citizens, other state agencies, local governments, nonprofits, utilities, industries, and other diverse stakeholders. TDEC coordinated with the three metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs) in Tennessee that received CPRG planning grants: Knoxville, Memphis, and Nashville. The resulting plan is meant to encompass and represent the entirety of the state and allow for state, regional, and local adaptations regarding projects and programs that can reduce emissions and benefit all Tennesseans. TDEC utilized data handling procedures to condense meaningful information into an accessible format for a broad audience in the PCAP. For each table and figure, data were carefully truncated/rounded to accurately represent data estimates and trends while avoiding extraneous details. Data rounding was dependent on the magnitude and type of data being presented and varied across data sets. Certain data sets were truncated to two decimal places, while others were not. These differences in data presentation occasionally resulted in minor discrepancies when comparing data across various tables and figures. The Project Team will explore a standard method of data rounding for the Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP). Next Steps The PCAP is the first deliverable in EPA's CPRG program. In Summer 2025, TDEC will submit the next deliverable to EPA: a CCAP. The CCAP will touch on all significant GHG sources/sinks and sectors present in Tennessee, establish near-term and long-term GHG emissions reduction goals, and provide strategies and identify measures to achieve those goals. TDEC intends to build upon the foundation established in the PCAP in developing the  11 CCAP. This includes further refining the TN PCAP Inventory to understand county-level emissions, broadening measures to achieve the state's GHG emissions reduction goals and continuing comprehensive coordination and engagement.},

  abstract = {We conduct the Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) periodically to provide detailed information about energy usage in U.S. homes. RECS is a multiyear project consisting of a household survey, data collection from household energy suppliers, and end-use consumption and expenditures estimation. The 2020 RECS, the 15th iteration of the study, was the largest in program history, with 18,496 household survey respondents. The Household Survey (HS), a voluntary survey, collects data on energy-related characteristics and usage patterns from a representative sample of homes that are occupied as a primary residence. We selected the sample to provide statistically reliable energy-use estimates at the national, regional, division, and state levels. The Energy Supplier Survey (ESS), a mandatory survey, collects data from energy suppliers on how much site electricity, natural gas, propane, and fuel oil were consumed in the sampled homes during the reference year. The ESS also collects data on actual dollar amounts spent on these energy sources. We use models (energy engineering-based models in the 2015 and 2020 survey) to produce consumption and expenditures estimates for heating, cooling, refrigeration, and other end uses in all homes occupied as a primary residence in the United States using the data collected from the HS and ESS. Wood-use estimates are also included as part of RECS. The scope and purpose of RECS differ slightly from similar EIA products that report residential energy data. For RECS, we sample homes occupied as a primary residence, which excludes secondary homes, vacant homes, military barracks, and common areas in apartment buildings. As a result, RECS estimates are not comparable with sector-level totals defined in other EIA products. They are best suited for comparison across different characteristics of homes within the residential sector. These RECS estimates represent the site energy consumption for occupied, primary homes, which excludes accounting for losses in generation and transmission of electricity. This document provides methodological descriptions for three parts of the overall RECS process: {$\bullet$} Energy Supplier Survey (ESS), which provides details on billing data collection, coverage rates, response rates, and billing data editing and quality {$\bullet$} Consumption and Expenditures Annualization and Imputation, which provides details on the consumption and expenditures estimation for calendar year 2020 using the ESS billing and delivery data {$\bullet$} End-use Estimation Modeling and Calibration, which provides details on the consumption estimation of household end uses and method changes from previous years The methodology for the RECS Household Survey and household energy-related characteristics, including sampling and weighting, is provided in a separate document called Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) 2020 Household Characteristics Technical Documentation Summary.

  abstract = {The EPA recognizes that there will be differences between the EPA's state-level estimates and some inventory estimates developed independently by individual state governments. Inventories compiled by states may differ for several reasons and differences do not necessarily mean that one set of estimates is more accurate, or "correct''. The EPA has strived to ensure that the coverage, methodological and accounting approaches are clearly described so that users can clearly understand differences with how states may compile their inventories. The results should be viewed as complementary and supplement existing state data. {$\bullet$} Organization of sectors. The EPA has organized estimates by sector and their respective source and sink categories consistent with the national Inventory and international reporting guidelines1 . Standardization of sectors in international reporting promotes comparability across countries and supports cooperation on climate action. States may use alternate organization of data, such as economic sectors, for presenting emissions rather than IPCC sectors. Some states may use IPCC sectors as the basis of their inventory, but allocate some categories differently across sectors, such as reporting some Industrial Process and Product Use categories in the Energy sector (e.g., SF6 from electrical transmission and distribution). Comparability also depends on similar coverage. The completeness and geographic disaggregation of the report are consistent with the national Inventory, meaning in addition to estimates for states, the methods also address emissions and removals occurring in the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and tribal lands. {$\bullet$} Methods and data. In some cases, the EPA may be using different methodologies, activity data, and emission factors, or may have access to the latest facility-level information through the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The EPA used as a basis, or starting point, the same methods or methods based on those used to compile the national-level estimates. States may use the same methods but use different sources of activity data. {$\bullet$} Accounting approaches. In other cases, states may have adopted different accounting decisions that differ from those adopted by the IPCC and UNFCCC, (e.g., use of different category definitions and emission scopes consistent with state laws and regulations). For example, the EPA's approach is to focus on emissions that occur within geographic state boundaries (``Scope 1''), whereas some states include emissions that are caused by activity within their borders but which actually occur in other states (``Scope 2 or 3'') or use consumption-based accounting approaches. For example, some states include emissions from imported electricity, or electricity production that occurs outside state boundaries. EPA's use of geographic state boundaries to allocate emissions is consistent with IPCC guidelines.2 Differences in accounting approaches also include differences in the approach to estimating transportation, crossborder aviation and marine emissions, or treatment of biogenic CO2. For example, the EPA does not include biogenic CO2 emissions in state energy sector totals because, in accordance with IPCC},

MOVES covers onroad vehicles such as cars, trucks and buses, and nonroad equipment such as bulldozers and lawnmowers. MOVES does not cover aircraft, locomotives, and commercial marine vessels. MOVES accounts for the phase-in of federal emissions standards, vehicle and equipment activity, fuels, temperatures, humidity, and emission control activities such as inspection and maintenance (I/M) programs. MOVES models calendar year 1990 and 1999 through 2060. Emissions from onroad and nonroad sources can be modeled at the national or county scale using either model defaults or user-supplied inputs. Emissions from onroad sources can also be modeled at a more detailed ``project'' scale if the user supplies detailed inputs describing project parameters. The onroad module uses operating modespecific emission rates to create a consistent approach across all three scales. MOVES is a bottom-up emissions model that is designed to estimate emissions from separate physical emission processes depending on the source. MOVES models ``fleet average'' emissions, rather than emissions from individual vehicles or equipment types. And MOVES adjusts emission rates to represent real-world conditions.

  abstract = {The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator--- commonly referred to as MOVES---is a set of modeling tools for estimating air pollution emissions produced by onroad (highway) and nonroad mobile sources. MOVES estimates the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), criteria pollutants and selected air toxics. The MOVES model is currently the official model for use for state implementation plan (SIP) submissions to EPA and for transportation conformity analyses outside of California. The model is also the primary modeling tool for estimating the impact of mobile source regulations on emission inventories. MOVES calculates emission inventories by multiplying emission rates by the appropriate emission-related activity, applying correction and adjustment factors as needed to simulate specific situations and then adding up the emissions from all sources and regions. Vehicle population and activity data are critical inputs for calculating emission inventories from emissions processes such as running exhaust, start exhaust and evaporative emissions. In MOVES, most running emissions are distinguished by operating modes, depending on road type and vehicle speed. Start emissions are determined based on the time a vehicle has been parked prior to the engine starting, known as a ``soak.'' Evaporative emission modes are affected by vehicle operation and the time that vehicles are parked. Emission rates are further categorized by grouping vehicles with similar fuel type, regulatory classification, and other vehicle characteristics into ``source bins.'' This report describes the sources and derivation for onroad vehicle population and activity information and associated adjustments as stored in the MOVES default database. In particular, this report describes the data used to fill the default database tables listed below in Table 1-1. Note that technical details on the default database values for emission rates, correction factors and other inputs, including information on nonroad equipment, are described in other MOVES technical reports.1 These data have been updated for MOVES4 from previous versions of MOVES. In MOVES4, we have updated vehicle activity based on newer data from Annual Energy Outlook, Highway Statistics, Transportation Energy Data Book, and School Bus Fleet Fact Book. We also updated vehicle distributions based on IHS2020 and relative mileage accumulations based on FHWA analysis. In addition, updates have been made for gliders, Class 2b and 3 light heavy-duty (LHD) vehicles, and electric vehicles for MOVES4. Properly characterizing emissions from onroad vehicles requires a detailed understanding of the vehicles that comprise the national fleet and their patterns of operation. The MOVES default database has a domain that encompasses the entire United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In MOVES, users may analyze emission inventories in 1990 and every year from 1999 to 2060. The national default activity information in MOVES provides a reasonable basis for estimating national emissions. As described in this report, the most important of these inputs, such as vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and population estimates, come from long-term systematic national measurements. 7  Due to the availability of these national measurements, the most recent year of measured data in the model and the base year for projected emissions, is 2021. It is important to note that uncertainties and variability in the default data contribute to the uncertainty in the resulting emission estimates. Therefore, MOVES has been specifically designed to accommodate the input of alternate, user-supplied activity data. In particular, when modellers estimate emissions for specific geographic locations, EPA guidance recommends replacing many of the MOVES fleet and activity defaults with local data. This is especially true for inputs where local data is more detailed or up to date than those provided in the MOVES defaults. EPA's Technical Guidance2 provides more information on customizing MOVES with local inputs. Population and activity data are ever changing as new historical data becomes available and new projections are generated. As part of the MOVES development process, the model undergoes major updates and review every few years. The significant updates made to MOVES since the MOVES2014 release were peer-reviewed under EPA's peer review guidance3 in two separate reviews conducted in 2017, 2019, and 2020. Materials from each peer review, including peerreview comments and EPA responses are located on the EPA's science inventory webpage.4 5 The development of fleet and activity inputs will continue to be an important area of focus and improvement for MOVES.},

Volume II is dedicated to the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program and the data collection activities inherent to that program. This guidance is part of a quality management system designed to ensure that the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program: (1) provides data of sufficient quality to meet the program's objectives, and (2) is implemented consistently across the Nation. The purpose of the Handbook is twofold. First, it provides additional information and guidance on the material covered in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) pertaining to the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program. Second, the document is intended to assist technical personnel at tribal, state and local monitoring organizations1  in developing and implementing a quality system for the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program. A quality management system (QMS), as defined by The American National Standard-Specifications and Guidelines for Quality Systems for Environmental Data Collection and Environmental Technology Programs (ANSI/ASQ E4),2 is:  ``a structured and documented management system describing the policies, objectives, principles, organizational authority, responsibilities, accountability, and implementation plan of an organization for ensuring the quality in its work processes, products, and services. The QMS provides the framework for planning, implementing, and assessing the work performed by the organization and for carrying out required quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) activities''. A monitoring organization's QMS for the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program is described in its quality assurance project plan (QAPP). Therefore, the Handbook has been written in a style similar to a QA project plan as specified in the document EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans for Environmental Data Operations (EPA QA/R5)3 . Environmental data operations (EDO) refer to the work performed to obtain, use, or report information pertaining to natural surroundings and conditions. The information in this Handbook can be used as guidance in the development of detailed monitoring organization QAPPs.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gases (GHGs) warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which the energy escapes to space; they act like a blanket insulating the Earth. Different GHGs can have different effects on the Earth's warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their "radiative efficiency"), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (also known as their "lifetime"). The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period. The time period usually used for GWPs is 100 years. GWPs provide a common unit of measure, which allows analysts to add up emissions estimates of different gases (e.g., to compile a national GHG inventory), and allows policymakers to compare emissions reduction opportunities across sectors and gases. CO2, by definition, has a GWP of 1 regardless of the time period used, because it is the gas being used as the reference. CO2 remains in the climate system for a very long time: CO2 emissions cause increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 that will last thousands of years. Methane (CH4) is estimated to have a GWP of 27-30 over 100 years. CH4 emitted today lasts about a decade on average, which is much less time than CO2. But CH4 also absorbs much more energy than CO2. The net effect of the shorter lifetime and higher energy absorption is reflected in the GWP. The CH4 GWP also accounts for some indirect effects, such as the fact that CH4 is a precursor to ozone, and ozone is itself a GHG.  Nitrous Oxide (N2O) has a GWP 273 times that of CO2 for a 100-year timescale. N2O emitted today remains in the atmosphere for more than 100 years, on average. (Learn why EPA's U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks uses a different value.) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are sometimes called high-GWP gases because, for a given amount of mass, they trap substantially more heat than CO2. (The GWPs for these gases can be in the thousands or tens of thousands.)},

  abstract = {During the last century, population and economic growth have caused increased consumption of materials such as minerals, wood products and food. Materials consumption continues to accelerate while simultaneously shifting away from renewable materials like agriculture and forestry products toward non-renewable products such as metals and fossil fuel-derived products (EPA, 2009b). Source reduction, reuse and recycling of materials are ways that we can manage materials more sustainably. Extracting, harvesting, processing, transporting and disposing of these materials result in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, in part due to the large amounts of energy required for these life-cycle stages. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) Waste Reduction Model (WARM), the focus of this documentation, is a tool designed to help managers and policy-makers understand and compare the life-cycle GHG, energy, and economic implications of materials management options (recycling, source reduction, landfilling, combustion with energy recovery, anaerobic digestion, and composting) for materials commonly found in the waste stream. By comparing a baseline scenario (e.g., landfilling) to an alternate scenario (e.g., recycling), WARM can assess the economic, energy, and GHG implications that would occur throughout the material life cycle. 1.1 MATERIALS MANAGEMENT CONTEXT The United States and the international community are focusing increasingly on a life-cycle materials management paradigm that considers the environmental impacts of materials at all life-cycle stages. Recognition is growing that, since traditional environmental policies focus on controlling ``end-ofpipe'' emissions, they do not provide a means for systematically addressing environmental impacts associated with the movement of materials through the economy. While ``end-of-pipe'' policies are often effective in controlling direct pollution, they may result in some environmental impacts being overlooked or shifted from one area of the life cycle to another (EPA, 2009b). The EPA Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM) (formerly the Office of Solid Waste and Emergency Response) found that 42 percent of U.S. 2006 GHG emissions were associated with the manufacturing, use and disposal of materials and products (EPA, 2009a). As a result, changing materials management patterns is an important strategy to help reduce or avoid GHG emissions. Reducing the amount of materials used to make products, extending product life spans, and maximizing recycling rates are examples of possible materials management strategies that can significantly reduce GHG emissions (EPA, 2009b). Private and public entities globally are moving toward life-cycle materials management. For example, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and the Kobe 3R Action Plan (a plan issued by the Group of Eight) have recommended that member countries pay increased attention to life-cycle approaches to material flows. Companies in the metals, cement, agribusiness, food and retail industries are also formulating approaches to increase efficiency and reduce environmental impacts by taking a life-cycle view of materials and processes (EPA, 2009b).},

  abstract = {This chapter describes the development of material-specific emission factors for source reduction in EPA's Waste Reduction Model (WARM). Source reduction, or waste prevention, refers to practices that reduce the amount of materials entering the waste stream, including changes in the design, manufacture, purchase or use of materials. This document provides examples of source reduction and a summary of how EPA estimated the GHG benefits from source reduction of materials. 1.1 TYPES OF SOURCE REDUCTION Source reduction can result from any activity that reduces the amount of a material or agricultural input needed and therefore used to make products or food.1 Some specific examples of source reduction practices are:  Redesigning products to use fewer materials (e.g., lightweighting, material substitution).  Reusing products and materials (e.g., a refillable water bottle).  Extending the useful lifespan of products.  Avoiding using materials in the first place (e.g., reducing junk mail, reducing demand for uneaten food). In addition to the activities above, there are limited circumstances where the emission factors can be used to estimate GHG benefits of substituting one material or product for another material or product. Section 1.3.2 presents considerations for estimating the GHG effects of material substitution. 1.2 A SUMMARY OF THE GHG IMPLICATIONS OF SOURCE REDUCTION When a material is source reduced, GHG emissions associated with producing the material and/or manufacturing the product and managing the post-consumer waste are avoided. Consequently, source reduction provides GHG emission benefits by: (1) avoiding the ``upstream'' GHGs emitted in the raw material acquisition, manufacture or production and transport of the source-reduced material; (2) increasing the amount of carbon stored in forests (when wood and paper products are source reduced); and (3) avoiding the downstream GHG emissions from waste management. Because many materials are manufactured from a mix of virgin and recycled inputs, the quantity of virgin material production that is avoided is not always equal to the quantity of material source reduced. Therefore, to estimate GHG emissions associated with source reduction, WARM uses a mix of virgin and recycled inputs, based on the national average for each material. However, WARM also allows users to evaluate the benefits of source reducing materials manufactured from 100 percent virgin inputs, instead of a mix of virgin and recycled inputs. For some materials, such as food waste and some wood products, it is either not possible or very uncommon to use recycled inputs during material production, so WARM always assumes material production using 100 percent virgin inputs. WARM assumes that source reduction of paper and wood products increases the amount of carbon stored in forests by reducing the amount of wood harvested. For more information on the calculations that went into creating the forest carbon storage offset, see the Forest Carbon Storage chapter. In order to measure the full GHG impact of source reduction, the user must compare the GHG emissions from source reduction to the GHG emissions of another materials management option. For example, a user could compare the benefits from source reducing one short ton of office paper instead},

The purpose of this document is to provide guidance to WARM users in downloading, installing, and using the WARM Tool, including an overview of the tool's key functions and capabilities. WARM calculates GHG emissions, energy, and economic impacts for baseline and alternative waste management practices, including source reduction, recycling, combustion, composting, and landfilling. The model calculates emissions in metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent (MTCO2E) and metric tons of carbon equivalent (MTCE), energy in millions of BTUs (MMBTU), wage impacts, tax impacts, and labor hours supported across a wide range of material types commonly found in municipal solid waste (MSW). The user can construct various scenarios by simply entering data on the amount of waste handled by material type and by management practice. WARM then automatically applies material-specific emission, energy, and economic factors for each management practice to calculate the GHG emissions, energy use, and economic impacts of each scenario. Several key inputs, such as landfill gas recovery practices and transportation distances to MSW facilities, can be modified by the user. The GHG emission factors used in WARM are based on a life cycle perspective. The model documentation describes this methodology in detail. The WARM model was implemented in the free, open source life-cycle assessment (LCA) software called openLCA. The resulting openLCA database is used for the calculation of impacts in the WARM Tool described in this guide. The WARM version implemented in this software is WARM v15 (November 2020)}

  abstract = {Heavy rain throughout the summer of 2023 caused severe flooding in Vermont, leaving lasng damage and a changed landscape throughout the state. Due to climate change these storms and weather paterns are the new normal, and Vermonters will connue to be impacted by the hazards caused by severe storms. Vermonters are also experiencing increased periods of prolonged drought, extreme temperatures, and poor air quality due to wildfire smoke; these condions highlight the increasingly urgent need for investment in climate migaon to address the myriad impacts of climate change. In 2020, the Vermont legislature adopted the Vermont Global Warming Soluons Act (GWSA), which converted Vermont's greenhouse gas (GHG) reducon goals into statutory requirements, created the Vermont Climate Council, and charged the Council with adopng, and subse quently updang, a Climate Acton Plan. Vermont is required to reduce its GHG emissions by no less than 26\% below 2005 GHG emission levels by January 1, 2025; by no less than 40\% below 1990 GHG emission levels by January 1, 2030; and no less than 80\% below 1990 GHG emission levels by January 1, 2050. The Inial Vermont Climate Acon Plan was adopted on December 1 of 2021 and includes 234 unique acons to migate, adapt to, or be more resilient to climate change. Achieving these goals will require enormous effort and investment in Vermont's economy and landscape. Vermont is making good progress to reduce its climate polluon through policies and recent federal funding from the American Rescue Plan Act, the Biparsan Infrastructure Bill, and now the Inflaon Reducon Act. Specifically, the Inflaon Reducon Act (IRA) offers a historic opportunity to make investments that will be crical to achieving those goals. The Vermont Agency of Natural Resources (ANR), Climate Acon Office, developed this Priority Climate Acon Plan as part of the Environmental Protecon Agency (EPA) Phase 1 Climate Polluon Reducon Grant Program. The grant program is one of many funding opportunies provided in the federal IRA and has the stated objecves to priorize measures: 1) that achieve maximum reducons in greenhouse gas emissions while driving benefits to surrounding communies, and 2) to invest in measures that are ready to receive funds to use over the next several years. This plan is not designed to address all the necessary and needed acons for emission reducons in Vermont. Instead, it is connuing the story of climate acon in Vermont. It has been developed to achieve the most impacul reducons, and in the most crical sectors, where other funding is not currently available. The Climate Acon Office (CAO), working collaboravely with the members of the Inter-Agency Advisory Board to the CAO, idenfied the measures included in this plan to meet EPA's criteria provided in the Noce of Funding Opportunity for the CPRG Implementaon grant. This plan builds upon the migaon work already advancing in Vermont by enhancing the scale and scope of exisng frameworks, analyses, policies, and programs. The four main mi{\dbend}ga{\dbend}on sectors iden{\dbend}fied in this plan are 1) transporta{\dbend}on, 2) residen{\dbend}al and commercial buildings, 3) natural and working lands, and 4) waste and materials management. The first three categories contribute the most to greenhouse gas emissions in Vermont, making up more than 90\% of the state's emissions. In addi{\dbend}on, mi{\dbend}ga{\dbend}on ac{\dbend}ons related to waste management have not advanced as far or as fast as other sectors, making it a high priority for ac{\dbend}on in this PCAP while u{\dbend}lizing the exis{\dbend}ng framework and partnerships developed by solid waste policies and priori{\dbend}es in ANR.  4 Transporta{\dbend}on -- the movement of people and goods -- is essen{\dbend}al to the state's economy and Vermonter's quality of life. The state's rural character and low popula{\dbend}on density also means that Vermonters depend primarily on cars and trucks to get around. Vermont's auto-reliant system is fueled almost en{\dbend}rely with carbon-intensive gasoline and diesel, making transporta{\dbend}on the largest source of climate pollu{\dbend}on -- a full 40\% of the state's greenhouse gas emissions. The combina{\dbend}on of our mostly rural nature, dispersed land use paterns and heavy reliance on fossil-fueled vehicles is a significant reason why Vermonters emit more greenhouse gases per capita than any other state in New England. This reality makes transforming the state's transporta{\dbend}on system essen{\dbend}al to mee{\dbend}ng the emissions reduc{\dbend}on requirements of the GWSA. Incen{\dbend}vizing zero-emission vehicles in all classes of vehicles and developing the necessary trainings to give consumers the confidence to buy these vehicles will achieve significant reduc{\dbend}ons in GHGs. Co-benefits include improved public health in communi{\dbend}es that are nearest to transporta{\dbend}on corridors by lowering tailpipe emissions of criteria pollutants such as diesel par{\dbend}culate mater, and toxic air pollutants such as benzene. Vermont also proposes to increase the use of idle reduc{\dbend}on technologies as a bridge to further reduce emissions in this sector. Vermont's housing stock is dominated by homes built before 1975, with over a quarter of them built before 1939. Thermal energy use for these buildings produces over a third of the state's GHG emissions and represents roughly 35 percent of our energy expenditures. Replacing carbon-intensive fossil-fueled hea{\dbend}ng sources with available, lower carbon alterna{\dbend}ves will significantly contribute to mee{\dbend}ng Vermont's climate goals. Further incen{\dbend}ves are needed to improve the efficiency of exis{\dbend}ng and new buildings, promote the transi{\dbend}on to clean equipment and appliances, and increase building weatheriza{\dbend}on to realize the pace and scale of the transi{\dbend}on needed by 2030. In addi{\dbend}on, further investments in support systems are needed to help low-income Vermonters easily access incen{\dbend}ves. Cobenefits include improved indoor air quality (including from wildfire smoke) and saving homeowners, business owners, and renters money on hea{\dbend}ng and cooling. Vermont farmers and forestland owners are mo{\dbend}vated to be part of climate change solu{\dbend}ons, and many already include climate mi{\dbend}ga{\dbend}on as a major goal in managing their woodlots and farms. Carbon sequestra{\dbend}on in agricultural landscapes and working forestlands is the mi{\dbend}ga{\dbend}on strategy that yields the greatest co-benefits, is the easiest and most immediate to implement, has equitable impacts, and has been priori{\dbend}zed by the global and scien{\dbend}fic communi{\dbend}es as a cri{\dbend}cal mi{\dbend}ga{\dbend}on strategy. Vermont envisions further suppor{\dbend}ng restora{\dbend}on ac{\dbend}vi{\dbend}es, land acquisi{\dbend}on, and agronomic prac{\dbend}ces through increased funding and capacity. The handling of waste and materials is an addi{\dbend}onal contributor of GHGs in Vermont, and while Vermont's Universal Recycling and Compos{\dbend}ng Law has made significant advancements in reducing emissions from this sector, there are opportuni{\dbend}es for more mi{\dbend}ga{\dbend}on-focused related to waste reduc{\dbend}on and management. The EPA es{\dbend}mates that wasted food generates nearly 60\% of methane emissions from landfills. Reducing the amount of food wasted and improving food scrap diversion programs at schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and other instuons will have a meaningful impact. Addional non-energy measures beyond waste management include addressing high global warming potenal refrigerants in two ways. Vermont plans to increase the rate of recovery of refrigerants from systems and appliances at the end of their life and replace refrigeraon equipment with technology that ulizes non ``f-gas'' or natural refrigerants.  5 This priority plan lays out the crical measures that will leverage federal investments to accelerate Vermont's climate migaon acvies and make sustainable emissions reducons throughout the economy. As this work advances, we envision robust engagement with Vermonters to realize the transformave changes needed to meet both the challenges and opportunies of climate change.},

  abstract = {The adoption of clean energy in Boston's buildings and transportation systems will produce sweeping changes in the quantity and composition of the city's demand for fuel and electricity. The demand for electricity is expected to increase by 2050, while the demand for petroleum-based liquid fuels and natural gas within the city is projected to decline significantly. The city must meet future energy demand with clean energy sources in order to meet its carbon mitigation targets. That clean energy must be procured in a way that supports the City's goals for economic development, social equity, environmental sustainability, and overall quality of life. This chapter examines the strategies to accomplish these goals. Improved energy efficiency, district energy, and in-boundary generation of clean energy (rooftop PV) will reduce net electric power and natural gas demand substantially, but these measures will not eliminate the need for electricity and gas (or its replacement fuel) delivered into Boston. Broadly speaking, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the city must therefore (1) reduce its use of fossil fuels to heat and cool buildings through cost-effective energy efficiency measures and electrification of building thermal services where feasible; and (2) over time, increase the amount of carbon-free electricity delivered to the city. Reducing energy demand though cost effective energy conservation measures will be necessary to reduce the challenges associated with expanding the electricity delivery system and sustainably sourcing renewable fuels.},

In order to achieve carbon neutrality, it is important to understand direct and indirect carbon emissions generated by WWTPs. Here, we focused on electricity use in WWTPs as it is a major source of carbon emissions. Specifically, we compared the electricity intensity and associated carbon emissions of WWTPs in four countries: the USA, Germany, China, and South Africa. We found that 100\% energy self-sufficient WWTPs are feasible by a combination of increased energy efficiency and energy harvesting from the wastewater. Carbon emissions of WWTPs depend strongly on the electricity fuel mix, wastewater treatment technologies, treatment capacity, and influent and effluent water quality. A few WWTPs operating in developed countries (USA and Germany) have already achieved almost 100\% (or higher) electricity self-sufficiency through energy efficiency and harvesting biogas and electricity. In comparison with Germany, WWTPs in the USA are more heterogeneous and the range of unit carbon emission intensity is much wider. In some areas where the organic content in wastewater is lower and less biogas is produced, it is still possible to achieve energy self-sufficiency by using thermal energy from wastewater. Industrial wastewater in China in general consumes more electricity and the carbon intensity of electricity is also higher, resulting in much higher unit carbon emissions as compared with other countries. In megacities such as Shanghai, larger capacity of centralized WWTPs can decrease the unit carbon emissions significantly. These findings provide a global perspective on the state of WWTPs and are helpful to improve the understanding, designing and operating of WWTPs from the perspective of achieving carbon neutrality.},

The CPRG planning grant enables states, metropolitan statistical areas (MSAs), and tribal governments to develop a Priority Climate Action Plan (PCAP), followed by a Comprehensive Climate Action Plan (CCAP) and Status Report (state and MSAs only), over a four-year period through 2027. EPA requires that all PCAPs include a GHG Inventory, quantified GHG reduction measures, a Low Income and Disadvantaged Communities (LIDAC) Benefits Analysis, as well as a review of authority to implement each measure. Washington also received funding for an MSA grant. The Puget Sound Clean Air Agency (Agency or PSCAA) is serving as the Lead Entity for the Phase 1 CPRG Planning Grant on behalf of the Seattle-Tacoma-Bellevue MSA, which covers all cities and counties in the four-county region of King, Kitsap, Pierce, and Snohomish counties. Skamania and Clark counties are included in the Portland, OR metro area MSA grant. The Washington PCAP presents a focused list of measures to reduce GHG emissions and harmful air pollution and maximize the benefits of climate action in overburdened communities in Washington. Many of the quantified priority measures contained in this PCAP are based on existing state, local and tribal, climate and clean energy plans and programs. The Department of Commerce (Commerce) was responsible for developing the PCAP, in partnership with the entities named in the Acknowledgements section. Commerce is aware that that are many additional priority actions for each sector that could be included in this PCAP and acknowledges that the list of priority measures included in Section 2.2 is not intended to be inclusive of all possible priority actions available to tribes, state agencies and local jurisdictions. Instead, these priority actions focus on measures for which an eligible entity is planning to seek Phase 2 CPRG funding, rather than an exhaustive list of all possible priority measures available to reduce emissions in the state. Commerce and the Washington State Department of Ecology (Ecology) will develop a comprehensive list of GHG measures in the CCAP, based on informal comments received on the PCAP, as well as existing state plans and other sources. A summary of measures that will be explored further in the CCAP can be found in Appendix C. Commerce also coordinated closely with the PSCAA, state agencies, and the Governor's Office, in the creation of the PCAP. This PCAP was informed by, and is a continuation of, the many climate planning efforts already underway by state, regional, county, and local jurisdictions across Washington. This PCAP serves as a resource and guide for implementing near-term priority GHG reduction strategies and actions in furtherance of CPRG Phase 2 Implementation Grants for tribes, state agencies and local communities in Washington.},

  abstract = {Background: Diesel exhaust is a complex mixture comprised of gases and particulate matter and is a contributor to ambient air pollution. To reduce health risks, recent changes in diesel engine technology have significantly altered the composition of diesel exhaust, primarily by lowering emissions of particulate matter. However, animal toxicological studies continue to report health effects following exposure to diesel exhaust from engines employing particulate filters. The cause of these effects remains unclear. Objective and methods: To gain an understanding of the role of both particle-filtered and whole diesel exhaust on specific health outcomes, we conducted a systematic review in which we examined animal toxicological and controlled human exposure studies that included a comparison between inhalation of particle-filtered and whole diesel exhaust on any health endpoint. Results: We identified 26 studies that met both the inclusion and study evaluation criteria. For most health outcomes, the particle filtration methods employed in the included studies did not appreciably attenuate the health effects associated with exposure to whole diesel exhaust. There were also several health endpoints for which significant effects were associated with exposure to either particle-filtered or whole diesel exhaust, but not to both. Conclusions: Overall, the results from this systematic review demonstrate that exposure to different components in diesel exhaust can have distinct and independent health effects. Thus, to better inform human health risk assessments, future studies aimed at elucidating the health effects from diesel exhaust should include exposure to both particle-filtered and whole diesel exhaust.},

  abstract = {The 2021 Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report was developed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Air Management Program to provide a high-level perspective of GHG emissions from various economic sectors in Wisconsin. This inventory is a tool that can be used to support climate planning priorities in state agencies such as the Wisconsin Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) State Inventory Tool (SIT) was used to develop this report. To compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across time, the report includes a GHG emissions inventory for 2005 and 2018 as well as a description of the GHG emissions trends in Wisconsin from 1990 through 2018. Greenhouse Gases and Emissions Sources The 2021 Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report includes emissions of seven major GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). For the purposes of this report, HFCs, PFCs, NF3 and SF6 are reported together as ``F-gases.'' The emissions are then allocated to nine economic sectors: electricity, residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, industrial process, natural gas and oil, waste and agriculture. Additionally, annual carbon storage from natural and working lands is reported in the land-use, land-use- change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. Results and Key Findings Figure ES-1 provides a summary of GHG emissions by economic sector. Figure ES-2 shows long-term emission trends from 1990-2018 by sector. Some key findings of the inventory report and analysis include: {$\bullet$} Gross GHG emissions in the state decreased by 6.1\% from 2005 to 2018, and net GHG emissions decreased by 9.1\% from 2005 through 2018. {$\bullet$} The electricity sector emitted the most GHGs in 2018 (32.3\% of gross emissions); the largest decrease in emissions from 2005 to 2018 (11.8 MMTCO2E) also came from this sector. {$\bullet$} Coal remained the largest source of CO2 emissions from the electricity generation sector in 2018, 81.6\%. {$\bullet$} The transportation, industrial, natural gas and oil and waste sectors also showed modest emission decreases from 2005 to 2018. {$\bullet$} Between 2005 and 2018, agriculture emissions increased by 3.5 MMTCO2E, the highest increase among all sectors. {$\bullet$} Emissions from the residential, commercial and industrial process sectors also increased from 2005 to 2018. {$\bullet$} LULUCF sector stored 19.1 MMTCO2E in 2018, a 20.1\% increase from the carbon stored in the sector in 2005. {$\bullet$} Carbon dioxide accounted for most of the GHG emissions in 2018, 81.4\%. In Executive Order \#38, Gov. Tony Evers committed Wisconsin to meeting U.S. climate targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement; that is, a 26-28\% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 values by 2025. While GHG emissions in the state have decreased since 2005, the state will need to do more to meet these emission reduction targets.},

Traffic\_Count\_AADT is a source of Wisconsin DOT traffic data information for road sections of the State Highways or select Local Federal-Aid roads. Traffic counts are reported as the number of vehicles expected to pass a given location on an average day of the year. This value is called the "annual average daily traffic" or AADT. The AADT is produced for either continuous count sites or short duration count sites. WisDOT collects continuous count data from about 320 permanent data collection locations primarily located on the State Trunk Highway System. Data at continuous count sites are scheduled to be collected in hourly intervals each day of the year. A short duration traffic count usually collects hourly intervals for a 48-hour period, taken at the specific locations throughout the state. Using continuous count data, short duration counts are then adjusted for the variation in traffic volume that occurs throughout the year. Short duration counts are collected over three, six, or ten-year cycles at more than 26,000 rural and urban locations throughout the state. In addition to Wisconsin DOT use for transportation management purposes, Wisconsin DOT is required to collect and report these statistics to the Federal Highway Administration monthly and annually.},

There is general agreement that the technical potential for sequestration of carbon in soil is significant, and some consensus on the magnitude of that potential. Croplands worldwide could sequester between 0.90 and 1.85 Pg C/yr, i.e. 26--53\% of the target of the ``4p1000 Initiative: Soils for Food Security and Climate''. The importance of intensively cultivated regions such as North America, Europe, India and intensively cultivated areas in Africa, such as Ethiopia, is highlighted. Soil carbon sequestration and the conservation of existing soil carbon stocks, given its multiple benefits including improved food production, is an important mitigation pathway to achieve the less than 2\,{$^\circ$}C global target of the Paris Climate Agreement.},
