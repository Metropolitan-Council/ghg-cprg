To support this, the county developed an inventory of GHG emissions from county residents, businesses, and organizations for the years 2006 through 2012. In 2020, this inventory was updated to include additional years and was used to inform Hennepin County's Climate Action Plan (May 2021) and revised GHG reduction goals. Since then, 2020 data has also been collected. This report provides a high-level overview of GHG emissions trends since 2006, including an analysis of the key drivers of change across this time period.},

  abstract = {For many people, their most perceptible interaction with their environmental footprint is through the waste that they generate. On a daily basis people have numerous opportunities to decide whether to recycle, compost or throwaway. In many cases, such options may not be present or apparent. Even when such options are available, many lack the knowledge of how to correctly dispose of their waste, leading to contamination of valuable recycling or compost streams. Once collected, people give little thought to how their waste is treated. For Boston's waste, plastic in the disposal stream acts becomes a fossil fuel used to generate electricity. Organics in the waste stream have the potential to be used to generate valuable renewable energy, while metals and electronics can be recycled to offset virgin materials. However, challenges in global recycling markets are burdening municipalities, which are experiencing higher costs to maintain their recycling. The disposal of solid waste and wastewater both account for a large and visible anthropogenic impact on human health and the environment. In terms of climate change, landfilling of solid waste and wastewater treatment generated emissions of 131.5 Mt CO2e in 2016 or about two percent of total United States GHG emissions that year. The combustion of solid waste contributed an additional 11.0 Mt CO2e, over half of which (5.9 Mt CO2e) is attributable to the combustion of plastic [1]. In Massachusetts, the GHG emissions from landfills (0.4 Mt CO2e), waste combustion (1.2 Mt CO2e), and wastewater (0.5 Mt CO2e) accounted for about 2.7 percent of the state's gross GHG emissions in 2014 [2]. The City of Boston has begun exploring pathways to Zero Waste, a goal that seeks to systematically redesign our waste management system that can simultaneously lead to a drastic reduction in emissions from waste. The easiest way to achieve zero waste is to not generate it in the first place. This can start at the source with the decision whether or not to consume a product. This is the intent behind banning disposable items such as plastic bags that have more sustainable substitutes. When consumption occurs, products must be designed in such a way that their lifecycle impacts and waste footprint are considered. This includes making durable products, limiting the use of packaging or using organic packaging materials, taking back goods at the end of their life, and designing products to ensure compatibility with recycling systems. When reducing waste is unavoidable, efforts to increase recycling and organics diversion becomes essential for achieving zero waste. Pursuing such zero waste strategies will have impacts beyond reducing carbon emissions. First such strategies will likely reduce the cost of waste management and disposal, relieving tax payers of these burdens. Second, bag bans and packaging requirements will spur producers to use sustainable solutions and help to promote innovation in product packaging and materials design. Accelerating such a transformation will have global impacts by shifting the materials used in our lives to be more sustainable, and limit their accumulation in natural systems such as our waterways and oceans. The City of Boston's consumption and waste streams extend far beyond the city's boarders. Changes to these external systems, outside of the City's control, will have a large influence over the footprint of people and businesses in the city. Despite this large external influence, there remain a large opportunity for the City and its constituents to take action to reduce their waste and waste-GHG footprints as described below.},

Previous life-cycle studies have focused on the automobile given its dominating share of passenger travel and have included only few life-cycle components, typically related to the vehicle (i.e., manufacturing, maintenance, end-of-life) or fuel (i.e., extraction, refining, transport). Chester (2009) provides the first comprehensive environmental life-cycle assessment of not only vehicle and fuel components but also infrastructure components for automobiles, buses, commuter rail systems, and aircraft. Many processes were included for vehicles (manufacturing, active operation, inactive operation, maintenance, insurance), infrastructure (construction, operation, maintenance, parking, insurance), and fuels (production, distribution). The vehicles inventoried were sedans, pickups, SUVs, urban diesel buses, light rail (San Francisco's Muni Metro and Boston's Green Line, both electric), heavy rail (San Francisco Bay Area's BART and Caltrain), and aircraft (small, medium, and large-sized planes are disaggregated). Given the methodological framework in Chester (2009), the question of applicability of these systems to other U.S. modes, and the data availability of other modes, is extended in this study to motorcycles, light duty diesel vehicles, school buses, electric buses, Chicago commuter rail modes, and New York City commuter rail modes.},

Damaging storms and floods have increased in frequency, and our winters are warming fast, reducing lake ice coverage across the state by 10 to 14 days over the past 50 years. Beloved Northwoods trees like spruce, aspen, and birch are expected to leave Minnesota over the next 80 years if we continue to change our climate. These changes are caused by human activities that release greenhouse gases (GHGs). This emissions inventory summarizes what we know about GHG emissions in Minnesota, including the major sources and trends over time. Tracking GHG emissions and identifying their sources are two important ways that state government can help Minnesotans understand our changing climate and respond accordingly. To guide our response to climate change, the State of Minnesota has developed a Climate Action Framework mn.gov/framework. The Framework identifies immediate, near-term actions to reduce climate pollution and prepare Minnesota communities for the impacts of climate change. It also sets new goals for Minnesota to reduce GHG emissions by 50\% by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2050. Analyzing Minnesota's emissions through this inventory allows us to track progress on the framework goals and focus actions for maximum impact to address climate change. This inventory documents Minnesota's GHG emissions from 2005 through 2020 and shows the impact of actions taken by individuals, organizations, and governments across Minnesota. The COVID-19 pandemic changed how Minnesotans lived and worked in 2020, further reducing emissions, but emissions were trending downward, even before the lifestyle shifts caused by the pandemic. Future years' data will show whether these are sustained trends or if some emissions bounced back when COVID-19 restrictions were eased. While there is much work ahead of Minnesota to meet our climate goals, this inventory demonstrates that collaborative action works.},

  abstract = {Problem: Localities and states are turning to land planning and urban design for help in reducing automobile use and related social and environmental costs. The effects of such strategies on travel demand have not been generalized in recent years from the multitude of available studies. Purpose: We conducted a meta-analysis of the built environment-travel literature existing at the end of 2009 in order to draw generalizable conclusions for practice. We aimed to quantify effect sizes, update earlier work, include additional outcome measures, and address the methodological issue of self-selection. Methods: We computed elasticities for individual studies and pooled them to produce weighted averages. Results and conclusions: Travel variables are generally inelastic with respect to change in measures of the built environment. Of the environmental variables considered here, none has a weighted average travel elasticity of absolute magnitude greater than 0.39, and most are much less. Still, the combined effect of several such variables on travel could be quite large. Consistent with prior work, we find that vehicle miles traveled (VMT) is most strongly related to measures of accessibility to destinations and secondarily to street network design variables. Walking is most strongly related to measures of land use diversity, intersection density, and the number of destinations within walking distance. Bus and train use are equally related to proximity to transit and street network design variables, with land use diversity a secondary factor. Surprisingly, we find population and job densities to be only weakly associated with travel behavior once these other variables are controlled. Takeaway for practice: The elasticities we derived in this meta-analysis may be used to adjust outputs of travel or activity models that are otherwise insensitive to variation in the built environment, or be used in sketch planning applications ranging from climate action plans to health impact assessments. However, because sample sizes are small, and very few studies control for residential preferences and attitudes, we cannot say that planners should generalize broadly from our results. While these elasticities are as accurate as currently possible, they should be understood to contain unknown error and have unknown confidence intervals. They provide a base, and as more built-environment/travel studies appear in the planning literature, these elasticities should be updated and refined.

In total, there are over 86,000 buildings that comprise more than 647 million square feet of area. Most of these buildings will still be in use in 2050. Floorspace (square footage) is almost evenly split between residential and non-residential uses, but residential buildings account for nearly 80,000 (93 percent) of the 86,000 buildings. Boston's buildings are used for a diverse range of activities that include homes, offices, hospitals, factories, laboratories, schools, public service, retail, hotels, restaurants, and convention space. Building type strongly influences energy use; for example, restaurants, hospitals, and laboratories have high energy demands compared to other commercial uses. Boston's building stock is characterized by thousands of turn-of-the-20th century homes and a postWorld War II building boom that expanded both residential buildings and commercial space. Boston is in the midst of another boom in building construction that is transforming neighborhoods across the city. The age of Boston's building stock is important because many of the city's residences were built before the 1950's and the establishment of the first building energy codes. These buildings typically have less insulation, are less air-tight, and use older, inefficient equipment, all of which result in higher energy use and GHG emissions compared to newer buildings. Recent buildings conform to a common energy code that aims to balance cost-effectiveness, building comfort, and environmental goals that leads to lower energy use and GHG emissions. Carbon-neutral buildings are highly efficient and do not use fossil fuels for heating and other services. New buildings will be built to the highest possible performance standards while avoiding the lock-in of fossil fuels. Existing buildings will require deep retrofits that reduce energy consumption and electrify heating systems. Achieving these goals requires a synergistic mix of fast-acting policies such as net zero codes, performance mandates, and retrofit requirements. These changes generate significant benefits but require significant upfront capital, a trained labor force, and the willingness and capacity of Boston's residents, businesses and institutions to invest in their buildings. These actions must also give socially vulnerable populations access to information, technical assistance, and financial resources. This will ensure that they can reap the benefits of lower utility bills, and not be further displaced as a result of higher housing costs, or left out of benefits that accrue to residents of new, efficient buildings},

  abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency defines offsets as a specific activity or set of activities intended to reduce GHG emissions, increase the storage of carbon, or enhance GHG removals from the atmosphere [1]. From a city perspective, they provide a mechanism to negate residual GHG emissions{\textemdash} those the city is unable to reduce directly{\textemdash}by supporting projects that avoid or sequester them outside of the city's reporting boundary. Offsetting GHG emissions is a controversial topic for cities, as the co-benefits of the investment are typically not realized locally. For this reason, offsetting emissions is considered a last resort, a strategy option available when the city has exhausted all others. However, offsets are likely to be a necessity to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and promote emissions reductions in the near term. While public and private sector partners pursue the more complex systems transformation, cities can utilize offsets to support short-term and relatively cost-effective reductions in emissions. Offsets can be a relatively simple, certain, and high-impact way to support the transition to a low-carbon world. This report focuses on carbon offset certificates, more often referred to as offsets. Each offset represents a metric ton of verified carbon dioxide (CO2) or equivalent emissions that is reduced, avoided, or permanently removed from the atmosphere (``sequestered'') through an action taken by the creator of the offset. The certificates can be traded and retiring (that is, not re-selling) offsets can be a useful component of an overall voluntary emissions reduction strategy, alongside activities to lower an organization's direct and indirect emissions. In the Global Protocol for Community-Scale Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventories (GPC), the GHG accounting system used by the City of Boston, any carbon offset certificates that the City has can be deducted from the City's total GHG emissions.},

To date, these two processes have not been studied together and compared with transboundary fossil fuel-based CO2 emissions of urban energy use. We leverage remote sensing and machine learning to quantify biogenic CO2 emissions between 2006 and 2012, across 11 U.S cities, including central and suburban cities, in different climate zones. Results indicate that in situ carbon sequestration by greenery varied moderately across cities (-2.1 to -0.87 Mg CO2 ha{\textendash}1 yr{\textendash}1), while emissions from the carbon stock change due to land conversion varied much more (-3.4 to 9.8 Mg CO2 ha{\textendash}1 yr{\textendash}1), indicating that the latter dominates biogenic CO2 emissions. Net biogenic CO2 emissions were negative (carbon sink) in four cities, while large net positive emissions were present in rapidly growing suburbs. As a ratio of community-wide energy use for travel and buildings, biogenic CO2 emissions were a small proportion in the core cities Denver (0.17\%) and Minneapolis (0.33\%) and as high as 38.2\% in growing exurban communities. These results show that land cover change and greenery will be important policy levers in zero-carbon city planning.}

  abstract = {Traffic data on all traffic volume products is represented as Annual Average Daily Traffic or AADT. This is an estimate of the total number of vehicles using a length of road (in both directions) on any given day of the year. This estimate represents the total number of cars per year divided by 365 days. The AADT are developed using factors that adjust for season, day of the week, and vehicle type. AADT values are subject to variability. Historical AADT's should be referenced along with the most current information. Traffic counts are scheduled before a project starts or after it is completed, but some construction effects are unavoidable when collecting traffic data. Construction affects traffic patterns on the entire road network, another reason why users should reference historical traffic volumes. Roadways Counted for AADT: Trunk Highways are major roadways: Interstate US Highway MN State Highway Local system roads are lesser roadways: County State Aid Highway County Road Municipal State Aid Street Other additional roadways as needed for federal reporting, such as: Municipal Non-State Aid Street Township Road Airport Road Vehicles traveling along a divided highway Vehicles traveling along a divided highway Traffic volume information has many uses: Creating annual Vehicle Miles Traveled (VMT) for state government use Annual reporting of VMT and AADT to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) for federal travel analysis and funding One of many factors in annual funding of the County and Municipal State Aid road systems Component of rail crossing safety reviews, speeds and crash rate analysis Facilitating decision making for planners, engineers, forecasters, businesses, and the general public The traffic volume program is funded in two parts. Data collection activities are funded by the MnDOT district or responsible agency.  Processing, review and publication are financed by federal funds. If time and/or resources in any given count season become limited the priorities of the program will be Trunk Highway and HPMS counts, followed by CSAH and MSAS, and finally County Roads. The traffic volume program produces AADT values for approximately 39,000 count locations and traffic segments. A traffic segment is a section of roadway where a single AADT value or traffic volume is applied. The traffic volumes along segments may vary within a range determined by a 1990 customer/user survey. Based on this survey, the traffic volume program developed the Acceptable Percent Change table: 4,100 on Trunk Highways 13,500 on County State Aid Highways 6,100 on County Roads 9,600 on Municipal State Aid Streets 3,700 on Ramps 2,000 on other roadways as needed for HPMS There are several ways to collect data for determining AADT: Workers installing continuous count sensors on a highway Workers installing continuous count sensors on a roadway At least 34,000 are short duration counts (typically 48 hours). These sites only collect traffic volume and make up the majority of all count locations. At least 2,000 are sites where data comes from the Regional Traffic Management Center.  These sites collect volume data from sensors or loop detectors which is extracted by MnDOT central office and converted to an AADT. At least 1,500 are Vehicle Classification sites. These collect traffic volume and vehicle type.  At least 180 are an Automatic Traffic Recorder, ATR.  These are continuous devices with loops in the pavement that collect traffic volume.  Some sites also collect vehicle classification and/or speed data. At least 20 are a Weigh in Motion System, WIM.  These are continuous sites that collect vehicle weight, type, speed and volume. How and Where Counts are Taken Most traffic data is collected by MnDOT District staff.  Some counties and cities, especially in the Metro, submit their own count data. MnDOT provides a yearly schedule of locations to count. Upon request, MnDOT will provide PDF maps or GIS files of the count locations.  Approximately half of the trunk highway locations and a quarter of the local system locations are scheduled each year.  Refer to the Traffic Counting Schedule reference for details. Most traffic counting occurs between April and October.  More details about field activities are available in our Program Guidelines for Site Scheduling, Count Collection, and Count Submission. MnDOT was recently given FWHA approval to use mobile sourced AADTs where they meet validation metrics.  To learn more please contact Traffic Forecasting and Analysis at MnDOT and/or review the overall workflow for how mobile sourced AADTs will be used: MnDOT Mobile Source AADT Workflow Summary. Raw counts may be submitted to MnDOT at any time, but may not be used if submitted past the annual reporting deadline.  Please contact the Traffic Volume Section for how to submit data. AADT values are determined in the fall/winter and sent to the local county/city engineer for comment. The Official AADT values, or Traffic Volumes, are then posted to the web the following spring/summer (Data Products). Materials used by partners who collect and submit short-term traffic data at established collection sites in Minnesota can be found in the shared MnDOT Traffic Data Collection Materials.}

RECS is a multiyear project consisting of a household survey, data collection from household energy suppliers, and end-use consumption and expenditures estimation. The 2020 RECS, the 15th iteration of the study, was the largest in program history, with 18,496 household survey respondents. The Household Survey (HS), a voluntary survey, collects data on energy-related characteristics and usage patterns from a representative sample of homes that are occupied as a primary residence. We selected the sample to provide statistically reliable energy-use estimates at the national, regional, division, and state levels. The Energy Supplier Survey (ESS), a mandatory survey, collects data from energy suppliers on how much site electricity, natural gas, propane, and fuel oil were consumed in the sampled homes during the reference year. The ESS also collects data on actual dollar amounts spent on these energy sources. We use models (energy engineering-based models in the 2015 and 2020 survey) to produce consumption and expenditures estimates for heating, cooling, refrigeration, and other end uses in all homes occupied as a primary residence in the United States using the data collected from the HS and ESS. Wood-use estimates are also included as part of RECS. The scope and purpose of RECS differ slightly from similar EIA products that report residential energy data. For RECS, we sample homes occupied as a primary residence, which excludes secondary homes, vacant homes, military barracks, and common areas in apartment buildings. As a result, RECS estimates are not comparable with sector-level totals defined in other EIA products. They are best suited for comparison across different characteristics of homes within the residential sector. These RECS estimates represent the site energy consumption for occupied, primary homes, which excludes accounting for losses in generation and transmission of electricity. This document provides methodological descriptions for three parts of the overall RECS process: {\textbullet} Energy Supplier Survey (ESS), which provides details on billing data collection, coverage rates, response rates, and billing data editing and quality {\textbullet} Consumption and Expenditures Annualization and Imputation, which provides details on the consumption and expenditures estimation for calendar year 2020 using the ESS billing and delivery data {\textbullet} End-use Estimation Modeling and Calibration, which provides details on the consumption estimation of household end uses and method changes from previous years The methodology for the RECS Household Survey and household energy-related characteristics, including sampling and weighting, is provided in a separate document called Residential Energy Consumption Survey (RECS) 2020 Household Characteristics Technical Documentation Summary.

  abstract = {The EPA recognizes that there will be differences between the EPA's state-level estimates and some inventory estimates developed independently by individual state governments. Inventories compiled by states may differ for several reasons and differences do not necessarily mean that one set of estimates is more accurate, or "correct''. The EPA has strived to ensure that the coverage, methodological and accounting approaches are clearly described so that users can clearly understand differences with how states may compile their inventories. The results should be viewed as complementary and supplement existing state data. {\textbullet} Organization of sectors. The EPA has organized estimates by sector and their respective source and sink categories consistent with the national Inventory and international reporting guidelines1 . Standardization of sectors in international reporting promotes comparability across countries and supports cooperation on climate action. States may use alternate organization of data, such as economic sectors, for presenting emissions rather than IPCC sectors. Some states may use IPCC sectors as the basis of their inventory, but allocate some categories differently across sectors, such as reporting some Industrial Process and Product Use categories in the Energy sector (e.g., SF6 from electrical transmission and distribution). Comparability also depends on similar coverage. The completeness and geographic disaggregation of the report are consistent with the national Inventory, meaning in addition to estimates for states, the methods also address emissions and removals occurring in the District of Columbia, U.S. territories, and tribal lands. {\textbullet} Methods and data. In some cases, the EPA may be using different methodologies, activity data, and emission factors, or may have access to the latest facility-level information through the EPA's Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP). The EPA used as a basis, or starting point, the same methods or methods based on those used to compile the national-level estimates. States may use the same methods but use different sources of activity data. {\textbullet} Accounting approaches. In other cases, states may have adopted different accounting decisions that differ from those adopted by the IPCC and UNFCCC, (e.g., use of different category definitions and emission scopes consistent with state laws and regulations). For example, the EPA's approach is to focus on emissions that occur within geographic state boundaries (``Scope 1''), whereas some states include emissions that are caused by activity within their borders but which actually occur in other states (``Scope 2 or 3'') or use consumption-based accounting approaches. For example, some states include emissions from imported electricity, or electricity production that occurs outside state boundaries. EPA's use of geographic state boundaries to allocate emissions is consistent with IPCC guidelines.2 Differences in accounting approaches also include differences in the approach to estimating transportation, crossborder aviation and marine emissions, or treatment of biogenic CO2. For example, the EPA does not include biogenic CO2 emissions in state energy sector totals because, in accordance with IPCC},

Emissions from onroad sources can also be modeled at a more detailed ``project'' scale if the user supplies detailed inputs describing project parameters. The onroad module uses operating modespecific emission rates to create a consistent approach across all three scales.

  abstract = {The United States Environmental Protection Agency's Motor Vehicle Emission Simulator{\textemdash} commonly referred to as MOVES{\textemdash}is a set of modeling tools for estimating air pollution emissions produced by onroad (highway) and nonroad mobile sources. MOVES estimates the emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs), criteria pollutants and selected air toxics. The MOVES model is currently the official model for use for state implementation plan (SIP) submissions to EPA and for transportation conformity analyses outside of California. The model is also the primary modeling tool for estimating the impact of mobile source regulations on emission inventories. MOVES calculates emission inventories by multiplying emission rates by the appropriate emission-related activity, applying correction and adjustment factors as needed to simulate specific situations and then adding up the emissions from all sources and regions. Vehicle population and activity data are critical inputs for calculating emission inventories from emissions processes such as running exhaust, start exhaust and evaporative emissions. In MOVES, most running emissions are distinguished by operating modes, depending on road type and vehicle speed. Start emissions are determined based on the time a vehicle has been parked prior to the engine starting, known as a ``soak.'' Evaporative emission modes are affected by vehicle operation and the time that vehicles are parked. Emission rates are further categorized by grouping vehicles with similar fuel type, regulatory classification, and other vehicle characteristics into ``source bins.'' This report describes the sources and derivation for onroad vehicle population and activity information and associated adjustments as stored in the MOVES default database. In particular, this report describes the data used to fill the default database tables listed below in Table 1-1. Note that technical details on the default database values for emission rates, correction factors and other inputs, including information on nonroad equipment, are described in other MOVES technical reports.1 These data have been updated for MOVES4 from previous versions of MOVES. In MOVES4, we have updated vehicle activity based on newer data from Annual Energy Outlook, Highway Statistics, Transportation Energy Data Book, and School Bus Fleet Fact Book. We also updated vehicle distributions based on IHS2020 and relative mileage accumulations based on FHWA analysis. In addition, updates have been made for gliders, Class 2b and 3 light heavy-duty (LHD) vehicles, and electric vehicles for MOVES4. Properly characterizing emissions from onroad vehicles requires a detailed understanding of the vehicles that comprise the national fleet and their patterns of operation. The MOVES default database has a domain that encompasses the entire United States, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. In MOVES, users may analyze emission inventories in 1990 and every year from 1999 to 2060. The national default activity information in MOVES provides a reasonable basis for estimating national emissions. As described in this report, the most important of these inputs, such as vehicle miles travelled (VMT) and population estimates, come from long-term systematic national measurements. 7  Due to the availability of these national measurements, the most recent year of measured data in the model and the base year for projected emissions, is 2021. It is important to note that uncertainties and variability in the default data contribute to the uncertainty in the resulting emission estimates. Therefore, MOVES has been specifically designed to accommodate the input of alternate, user-supplied activity data. In particular, when modellers estimate emissions for specific geographic locations, EPA guidance recommends replacing many of the MOVES fleet and activity defaults with local data. This is especially true for inputs where local data is more detailed or up to date than those provided in the MOVES defaults. EPA's Technical Guidance2 provides more information on customizing MOVES with local inputs. Population and activity data are ever changing as new historical data becomes available and new projections are generated. As part of the MOVES development process, the model undergoes major updates and review every few years. The significant updates made to MOVES since the MOVES2014 release were peer-reviewed under EPA's peer review guidance3 in two separate reviews conducted in 2017, 2019, and 2020. Materials from each peer review, including peerreview comments and EPA responses are located on the EPA's science inventory webpage.4 5 The development of fleet and activity inputs will continue to be an important area of focus and improvement for MOVES.},

This guidance is part of a quality management system designed to ensure that the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program: (1) provides data of sufficient quality to meet the program's objectives, and (2) is implemented consistently across the Nation. The purpose of the Handbook is twofold. First, it provides additional information and guidance on the material covered in the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) pertaining to the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program. Second, the document is intended to assist technical personnel at tribal, state and local monitoring organizations1  in developing and implementing a quality system for the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program. A quality management system (QMS), as defined by The American National Standard-Specifications and Guidelines for Quality Systems for Environmental Data Collection and Environmental Technology Programs (ANSI/ASQ E4),2 is:  ``a structured and documented management system describing the policies, objectives, principles, organizational authority, responsibilities, accountability, and implementation plan of an organization for ensuring the quality in its work processes, products, and services. The QMS provides the framework for planning, implementing, and assessing the work performed by the organization and for carrying out required quality assurance (QA) and quality control (QC) activities''. A monitoring organization's QMS for the Ambient Air Quality Surveillance Program is described in its quality assurance project plan (QAPP). Therefore, the Handbook has been written in a style similar to a QA project plan as specified in the document EPA Requirements for Quality Assurance Project Plans for Environmental Data Operations (EPA QA/R5)3 . Environmental data operations (EDO) refer to the work performed to obtain, use, or report information pertaining to natural surroundings and conditions. The information in this Handbook can be used as guidance in the development of detailed monitoring organization QAPPs.},

  abstract = {Greenhouse gases (GHGs) warm the Earth by absorbing energy and slowing the rate at which the energy escapes to space; they act like a blanket insulating the Earth. Different GHGs can have different effects on the Earth's warming. Two key ways in which these gases differ from each other are their ability to absorb energy (their "radiative efficiency"), and how long they stay in the atmosphere (also known as their "lifetime"). The Global Warming Potential (GWP) was developed to allow comparisons of the global warming impacts of different gases. Specifically, it is a measure of how much energy the emissions of 1 ton of a gas will absorb over a given period of time, relative to the emissions of 1 ton of carbon dioxide (CO2). The larger the GWP, the more that a given gas warms the Earth compared to CO2 over that time period. The time period usually used for GWPs is 100 years. GWPs provide a common unit of measure, which allows analysts to add up emissions estimates of different gases (e.g., to compile a national GHG inventory), and allows policymakers to compare emissions reduction opportunities across sectors and gases. CO2, by definition, has a GWP of 1 regardless of the time period used, because it is the gas being used as the reference. CO2 remains in the climate system for a very long time: CO2 emissions cause increases in atmospheric concentrations of CO2 that will last thousands of years. Methane (CH4) is estimated to have a GWP of 27-30 over 100 years. CH4 emitted today lasts about a decade on average, which is much less time than CO2. But CH4 also absorbs much more energy than CO2. The net effect of the shorter lifetime and higher energy absorption is reflected in the GWP. The CH4 GWP also accounts for some indirect effects, such as the fact that CH4 is a precursor to ozone, and ozone is itself a GHG.  Nitrous Oxide (N2O) has a GWP 273 times that of CO2 for a 100-year timescale. N2O emitted today remains in the atmosphere for more than 100 years, on average. (Learn why EPA's U.S. Inventory of Greenhouse Gas Emissions and Sinks uses a different value.) Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6) are sometimes called high-GWP gases because, for a given amount of mass, they trap substantially more heat than CO2.

  abstract = {The adoption of clean energy in Boston's buildings and transportation systems will produce sweeping changes in the quantity and composition of the city's demand for fuel and electricity. The demand for electricity is expected to increase by 2050, while the demand for petroleum-based liquid fuels and natural gas within the city is projected to decline significantly. The city must meet future energy demand with clean energy sources in order to meet its carbon mitigation targets. That clean energy must be procured in a way that supports the City's goals for economic development, social equity, environmental sustainability, and overall quality of life. This chapter examines the strategies to accomplish these goals. Improved energy efficiency, district energy, and in-boundary generation of clean energy (rooftop PV) will reduce net electric power and natural gas demand substantially, but these measures will not eliminate the need for electricity and gas (or its replacement fuel) delivered into Boston. Broadly speaking, to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050, the city must therefore (1) reduce its use of fossil fuels to heat and cool buildings through cost-effective energy efficiency measures and electrification of building thermal services where feasible; and (2) over time, increase the amount of carbon-free electricity delivered to the city. Reducing energy demand though cost effective energy conservation measures will be necessary to reduce the challenges associated with expanding the electricity delivery system and sustainably sourcing renewable fuels.},

  abstract = {The 2021 Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report was developed by the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (DNR) Air Management Program to provide a high-level perspective of GHG emissions from various economic sectors in Wisconsin. This inventory is a tool that can be used to support climate planning priorities in state agencies such as the Wisconsin Office of Sustainability and Clean Energy. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA's) State Inventory Tool (SIT) was used to develop this report. To compare greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions across time, the report includes a GHG emissions inventory for 2005 and 2018 as well as a description of the GHG emissions trends in Wisconsin from 1990 through 2018. Greenhouse Gases and Emissions Sources The 2021 Wisconsin Greenhouse Gas Emissions Inventory Report includes emissions of seven major GHGs: carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4), nitrous oxide (N2O), hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs), perfluorocarbons (PFCs), nitrogen trifluoride (NF3) and sulfur hexafluoride (SF6). For the purposes of this report, HFCs, PFCs, NF3 and SF6 are reported together as ``F-gases.'' The emissions are then allocated to nine economic sectors: electricity, residential, commercial, industrial, transportation, industrial process, natural gas and oil, waste and agriculture. Additionally, annual carbon storage from natural and working lands is reported in the land-use, land-use- change and forestry (LULUCF) sector. Results and Key Findings Figure ES-1 provides a summary of GHG emissions by economic sector. Figure ES-2 shows long-term emission trends from 1990-2018 by sector. Some key findings of the inventory report and analysis include: {\textbullet} Gross GHG emissions in the state decreased by 6.1\% from 2005 to 2018, and net GHG emissions decreased by 9.1\% from 2005 through 2018. {\textbullet} The electricity sector emitted the most GHGs in 2018 (32.3\% of gross emissions); the largest decrease in emissions from 2005 to 2018 (11.8 MMTCO2E) also came from this sector. {\textbullet} Coal remained the largest source of CO2 emissions from the electricity generation sector in 2018, 81.6\%. {\textbullet} The transportation, industrial, natural gas and oil and waste sectors also showed modest emission decreases from 2005 to 2018. {\textbullet} Between 2005 and 2018, agriculture emissions increased by 3.5 MMTCO2E, the highest increase among all sectors. {\textbullet} Emissions from the residential, commercial and industrial process sectors also increased from 2005 to 2018. {\textbullet} LULUCF sector stored 19.1 MMTCO2E in 2018, a 20.1\% increase from the carbon stored in the sector in 2005. {\textbullet} Carbon dioxide accounted for most of the GHG emissions in 2018, 81.4\%. In Executive Order \#38, Gov. Tony Evers committed Wisconsin to meeting U.S. climate targets set in the 2015 Paris Agreement; that is, a 26-28\% reduction in GHG emissions from 2005 values by 2025. While GHG emissions in the state have decreased since 2005, the state will need to do more to meet these emission reduction targets.},

These statistics are intended for use by the government for transportation management and used by businesses and the public. Transportation management uses this information for transportation planning, programming, highway design, maintenance, traffic control, and general administration of highway systems The Wisconsin Traffic Counts dataset combines traffic count data with GIS mapping technology to display data in a tabular format, on a map, or both. Traffic\_Count\_AADT is a source of Wisconsin DOT traffic data information for road sections of the State Highways or select Local Federal-Aid roads. Traffic counts are reported as the number of vehicles expected to pass a given location on an average day of the year. This value is called the "annual average daily traffic" or AADT. The AADT is produced for either continuous count sites or short duration count sites. WisDOT collects continuous count data from about 320 permanent data collection locations primarily located on the State Trunk Highway System. Data at continuous count sites are scheduled to be collected in hourly intervals each day of the year. A short duration traffic count usually collects hourly intervals for a 48-hour period, taken at the specific locations throughout the state. Using continuous count data, short duration counts are then adjusted for the variation in traffic volume that occurs throughout the year. Short duration counts are collected over three, six, or ten-year cycles at more than 26,000 rural and urban locations throughout the state. In addition to Wisconsin DOT use for transportation management purposes, Wisconsin DOT is required to collect and report these statistics to the Federal Highway Administration monthly and annually.},
